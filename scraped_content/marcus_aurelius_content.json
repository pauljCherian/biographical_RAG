Few even of his friends were allowed to know how closely and continuously Farquharson lived with the subject of his studies. Only the evidence of his library—the hundreds of volumes bearing in their margins 'copious notes' and forests of cross-references, written in his delicate, even, hand and dating, some of them, from his undergraduate days—has revealed the range and the detail of his inquisition into the form and matter of the \nMeditations\n, how early he began it and how deeply it absorbed him. \n\nMany drafts of passages of exegesis and annotation—discarded, resumed, altered, discarded, and again adopted, and all in that same faultless script—attest the diffidence with which he undertook the work and make it difficult to trace the stages of its composition. \n\nRecords, however, show that it was in March 1936 that he first discussed with the Clarendon Press the plan of his book and that the Delegates accepted it in February 1938. In June 1939 the MS., excluding the Notes, was sent to the Printer. When Farquharson died in August 1942 Volume I was printed off (save for the Introduction, which he had seen in proof), and of Volume II he had seen rather more than half (pp. 433–717) in proof, and passed for press pp. 433–608. The remainder of the Notes in Vol. II was in MS., perfectly ready for the press. How many alterations he might yet have made in this portion of the Notes it is impossible to say, for he was always ready to abandon or rewrite the fairest of fair copies if he thought improvement possible. \n\nIn a series of letters which he wrote to me weekly from the outbreak of war in September 1939 Farquharson \n​\noften referred to the progress he was making with the work. The 'mechanic exercise', the application it demanded, and the precepts and spirit of the text (with which he was deeply imbued, though I do not think that he was altogether a Stoic), evidently helped him to go through difficult times with equanimity. But his letters revealed also two sources of anxiety: a sense that he had performed his task inadequately, and a gradually increasing fear that he would not live to see it finished. I tried to persuade him that his dissatisfaction with his work was due rather to a habit of self-depreciation, which indeed with him had become a second nature, than to a perception of actual shortcomings in it; and when he spoke of his death I could only assure him that if the need arose I would see his book through the press, as he had entreated me to do. \n\nThat promise is now fulfilled, though circumstances have allowed me to perform myself only a very little of the labour involved. Mr. David Rees, Postmaster of Merton College, sitting in Farquharson's study and working with his papers and his books with only slight collaboration on my part, attended, with infinite patience and the most scrupulous care, to the passing for press of the first proofs of pp. 718–902 and the revises of pp. 609–902, and of the first proofs and revises of the Introduction. The Indexes are entirely his work. \n\nThe rule observed in carrying out our task was to leave unaltered everything except false references and slips which were manifestly due to an oversight. Disagreement with a comment or preference for another mode of expression, even if there seemed a valid reason for it, was never treated as justifying an alteration. Our aim has been to give what Farquharson really meant to print at the time when he completed his MS. The perfect \n​\nclarity and finish of that MS. lightened a laborious, if fascinating, task. \n\nWhat the book owed in its final stages to Mr. Rees will be plain from what is said above. I must also make acknowledgement, which Farquharson himself would have made more fittingly, to \nMr. E. C. Marchant\n, Fellow of Lincoln College, to whose judgement he referred almost every part of his work from its earliest to its latest stages, and whose scholarship Mr. Rees and I have accepted in cases of doubt as a final arbiter. Our thanks are also due to the Delegates of the Clarendon Press for pushing on the publication of the book in spite of many competing war-time claims upon the Press. \n\nI cannot conclude this Preface without recording two debts which Farquharson himself would not, I think, have passed over in silence—debts to two who were in different senses his companions throughout the work: one, to his wife, whose pure taste and deep sympathy were for him unfailing resources; the other, to his precursor \nThomas Gataker\n, for whom he habitually expressed an admiration and a reverence second only to his admiration and reverence for 'the Emperor' himself. \n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN SPARROW.\n\n\n\n\n\nOct. 1943.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n​\n \n\n\nPRINTED IN\nGREAT BRITAIN\nAT THE\nUNIVERSITY PRESS\nOXFORD\nBY\nJOHN JOHNSON\nPRINTER\nTO THE\nUNIVERSITY\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This work is a translation and has a separate copyright status to the applicable copyright protections of the original content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work was published before January 1, 1930, and is in the \npublic domain\n worldwide because the author died at least 100 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic domain\nPublic domain\nfalse\nfalse\n\n\n\n\nTranslation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is in the \npublic domain\n in the United States\n because it was \nlegally published\n within the United States (or the United Nations Headquarters in New York subject to Section 7 of the \nUnited States Headquarters Agreement\n) before 1964, and copyright was not renewed.\n\n\n\nFor Class A renewal records (\nbooks\n only) published between 1923 and 1963, check the \nStanford University Copyright Renewal Database\n.\n\n\nFor other renewal records of publications between 1922–1950, see the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania copyright records\n.\n\n\nFor all records since 1978, search the \nU.S. Copyright Office\n records.\n\n\nWorks published in 1944 could have had their copyright renewed in 1971 or 1972, \ni.e.\n between January 1st of the 27th year after publication or registration and December 31st of the 28th year.
