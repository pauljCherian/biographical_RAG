    "content": "(from \nJulius Caesar\n, spoken by Marc Antony)\nFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;\nI come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\nThe evil that men do lives after them;\nThe good is oft interred with their bones;\nSo let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\nHath told you Caesar was ambitious:\nIf it were so, it was a grievous fault,\nAnd grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.\nHere, under leave of Brutus and the rest–\nFor Brutus is an honourable man;\nSo are they all, all honourable men–\nCome I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.\nHe was my friend, faithful and just to me:\nBut Brutus says he was ambitious;\nAnd Brutus is an honourable man.\nHe hath brought many captives home to Rome\nWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:\nDid this in Caesar seem ambitious?\nWhen that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:\nAmbition should be made of sterner stuff:\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\nAnd Brutus is an honourable man.\nYou all did see that on the Lupercal\nI thrice presented him a kingly crown,\nWhich he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?\nYet Brutus says he was ambitious;\nAnd, sure, he is an honourable man.\nI speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\nBut here I am to speak what I do know.\nYou all did love him once, not without cause:\nWhat cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?\nO judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,\nAnd men have lost their reason. Bear with me;\nMy heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me.",

It is not certain how far we can accept them as authentic. The first is reported by Dio Cassius, who was twenty at the time of its delivery, and as he lived at Rome, and afterwards held high office in the state, he had ample sources of information. He expressly states that Marcus read this address to the soldiers on the rebellion of Cassius, and being written it was more likely to have been preserved verbatim. It cannot be denied that the speech has touches characteristic of Marcus, but of course these might have been purposely introduced by a skilful forger. On the other hand the style is rather rhetorical and artificial and more in keeping with Dio’s known proclivities. Still there is a dignity and restraint, not altogether unworthy of the occasion, noticeable throughout. Unfortunately it only comes to us in the epitome of Xiphilinus, and we do not know how far he has curtailed it, and it certainly seems\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nSee above, i. 7; Fronto, \nDe Eloq\n. 3.\n2\nSee above, L 17, § 4.\n3\nDio, 71. 35, §1.\n346\n\n\ntoo short for such an occasion. In any case it must have been delivered in Latin.\n\n\nThe last remark applies also to the dying speech of Marcus as given by Herodian, another contemporary authority, but one who was fond of composing suitable speeches for his characters when what they had actually said was not recoverable. The shortness of this speech may be said to be in its favour, as the Emperor was in the last stages of his illness. The opening words are perhaps too plaintive and personal, but the remainder is natural and appropriate. The last few words of such a ruler and friend must have impressed his hearers and may well have been taken down at the time. Still it is strange that there is no hint of this speech in the description of the last scene given by Capitolinus.\n1\n\n\nThe third speech, from the “Life of Avidius Cassius”\nby Gallicanus, is much less likely to be genuine. That particular piece of work is full of suspected material, and Marius Maximus, from whom this speech is probably taken, though a contemporary, is not a trustworthy authority, while the diction and absurd rhetoric of the missive, for it was a speech sent to the Senate and not delivered in it, are decidedly against its genuineness.\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs the Speeches and Sayings cannot definitely be attributed to Marcus Aurelius it was thought advisable to print them in smaller type in order to distinguish them from his authentic work.\n\n\n1\nWho here uses as his authority “The last great historian of Rome”; see \nDas Kaiserhaus der Antonine und der Letzte Historiker Roms\n, Otto Th. Schulz, p. 128, who thinks the anonymous writer may have been Lollius Urbicus. See Lampr. \nVit. Diadum\n. ix. 2.\n347\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFind related works\nMarcus Aurelius\nGreek Library\n100 AD – 200 AD\nProse\nOratory: Forensic\n\n\n\n\nDOI: 10.4159/DLCL.marcus_aurelius-speeches.1916",

    "content": "1 From my grandfather Verus [I learned] good morals and the government of my temper.\n\n\n2. From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character.\n\n\n3. From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.\n\n\n4. From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.\n\n\n5. From my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue iusparty at the games in the Circus, nor a partizan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius at the gladiators’ fights; from him too I learned endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people’s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.\n\n\n6. From Diognetus, not to busy myself about trifling things, and not to give credit to what was said by miracle-workers and jugglers about incantations and the driving away of daemons and such things; and not to breed quails [for fighting], nor to give myself up passionately to such things; and to endure freedom of speech; and to have become intimate with philosophy; and to have been a hearer, first of Bacchius, then of Tandasis and Marcianus; and to have written dialogues in youth; and to have desired a plank bed and skin, and whatever else of the kind belongs to the Grecian discipline.\n\n\n7. From Rusticus I received the impression that my character required improvement and discipline; and from him I learned not to be led astray to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters, nor to delivering little hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off as a man who practices much discipline, or does benevolent acts in order to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine writing; and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other things of the kind; and to write my letters with simplicity, like the letter which Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa to my mother; and with respect to those who have offended me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled, and to read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book; nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch; and I an indebted to him for being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, which he communicated to me out of his own collection.\n\n\n8. From Appollonius I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except to reason; and to be always the same, in sharp pains, on the occasion of the loss of a child, and in long illness; and to see clearly in a living example that the same man can be both most resolute and yielding, and not peevish in giving his instruction; and to have had before my eyes a man who clearly considered his experience and his skill in expounding philosophical principles as the smallest of his merits; and from him I learned how to receive from friends what are esteemed favours, without being either humbled by them or letting them pass unnoticed.\n\n\n9. From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family governed in a fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature; and gravity without affection, and to look carefully after the interests of friends, and to tolerate ignorant persons, and to those who form opinions without consideration: he had the power of readily accommodating himself to all, so that intercourse with him was more agreeable than any flattery; and at the time he was most highly venerated by those who associate with him: and he had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in an intelligent and methodical way, the principles necessary for life; and he never showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free from passion, and also most affectionate; and he could express approbation without noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.\n\n\n10. From Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and not in a reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous or solecistic or strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce the very expression which ought to have been used, and in the way of answer or giving confirmation, or joining in an inquiry about the thing itself, not about the word, by some other fit suggestion.\n\n\n11. From Fornto I learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy are in a tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called Patricians are rather deficient in paternal affection.\n\n\n12. From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity to say to any one, or to write in a letter, that I have no leisure; nor continually to excuse the neglect of duties required by our relation to those with whom we live, by alleging urgent occupations.\n\n\n13. From Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even if he should find fault without reason, but to try to restore him to his usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well of teachers, as it is reported of Domitius and Athenodotus; and to love my children truly.\n\n\n14. From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice; and through him I learned to know Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion, Brutus; and from him I received the idea of a polity in which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kindly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed; I learned from him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in my regard for philosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to give to others readily, and to cherish good hopes, and to believe that I am loved by my friends; and in him I observed no concealment, and that his friends had no need to conjecture what he wished or did not wish, but it was quite plain.\n\n\n15. From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; and a just mixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could be diverted from right rather than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever venture to think himself a better man. He had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way.\n\n\n16. In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and no vainglory in those things which men call honors; and love of labor and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness in giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived from experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission. And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more than any other citizen; and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of necessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through being satisfied with appearances that first present themselves; and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be too soon tired of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off, and to provide for the smallest without display; and to be ever watchful over the things which were necessary for the administration of the empire, and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither superstitious with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, nor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affection, and when he had them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that he was either a sophist or a [home-bred] flippant slave or a pedant; but everyone acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery, able to manage his own and other men’s affairs. Besides this he honored those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without any offensive affection. He took a reasonable care of his body’s health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician’s art or of medicine or external applications. He was most ready to give way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty, such as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or of anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy reputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation of doing so. Further, he was not fond of change or unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His secrets were not many, but very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles and the construction of public buildings, his donations to the people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be done, not to the reputation which is got by a man’s acts. He did not take the bath at unreasonable hours: he was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from Lorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know how he behaved by the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon; and such was all his behavior. There was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he had abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously and consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus.\n\n\n17. To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kins men and friends, nearly everything good. Further, I owe it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them, though I had a disposition which, if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something of this kind; but, through their favour, there never was such a concurrence of circumstances as put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was no longer brought up with my grandfather’s concubine, and that I preserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not make proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that it was possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in such a man’s power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private person, without being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits the ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother, who was able by his moral character to rouse me to vigilance over myself, and who, at the same time, pleased me by his respect and affection; that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to place those who brought me up in the station of honour, which they seemed to desire, without putting them off with the hope of my doing it sometime after, because they were then still young; that I knew Appollonius, Rusticus, Maximus; that I received clear and frequent impressions about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations, nothing hindered me from forthwith living according to nature, though I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions; that my body has held out so long in such a kind life; that I never touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often out of humor with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it was my mother’s fate to die young, she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished help any man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the same necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that I had abundance of good masters for my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and against bloodspitting and giddiness (text corrupt), and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy, ] did not waste my time on writers [of histories], or in the resolution of syllogisms, or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances in the heavens; for all these things require the help of the gods and fortune.\n\n\nAmong the Quadi at the Granua.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nBegin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him. For we are made for co-operation, like feet, hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the lower and upper teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.\n\n\n2. Whatever this is that I am, it is a little flesh and breath, and the ruling part. Throw away thy books; no longer distract thyself: it is not allowed; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh; it is blood and bones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins, and arteries. See the breath also, what kind of a thing it is, air, and not always the same, but every moment sent out and again sucked in. The third then is the ruling part: consider thus: Thou art an old man; no longer let this be a slave, no longer be pulled by the strings like a puppet to unsocial movements, no longer be either dissatisfied with thy present lot, or shrink from the future.\n\n\n3. All that is from the gods is full of providence. That which is from fortune is not separated from nature or without an interweaving and involution with the things which are ordered by providence. From thence all things flow; and there is besides necessity, and that which is for the advantage of the whole universe, of which thou art a part. But this is good for every part of nature which the nature of the whole brings, and what serves to maintain this nature. Now the universe is preserved, as by changes of the elements so by the changes of things compounded of the elements. Let these principles be enough for thee, let them always be fixed opinions. But cast away the thirst after books, that thou mayest not die murmuring, but cheerfully, truly, and from thy heart thankful to the gods.\n\n\n4. Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.\n\n\n5. Every moment think steadily as a Roman and a man to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice; and to give thyself relief from all other thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou dost every act of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given thee. Thou seest how few the things are, the which if a man lays hold of, he is able to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like the existence of the gods; for the gods on their part will require nothing more from him who observes these things.\n\n\n6. Do wrong to thyself, do wrong to thyself, my soul; but thou wilt no longer have the opportunity of honouring thyself. Every man’s life is sufficient. But thine is nearly finished, though thy soul reverences not itself, but places thy felicity in the souls of others.\n\n\n7. Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around. But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way. For those too are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their activity, and yet have no object to which to direct every movement, and, in a word, all their thoughts.\n\n\n8. Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has seldom been seen to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.\n\n\n9. This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole, and what is my nature, and how is this related to that, and what kind of a part is it of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one who hinders thee from always doing and saying the things which are according to the nature of which thou art a part.\n\n\n10. Theophrastus, in his comparison of bad acts—such a comparison as one would make in accordance with the common notions of mankind—says, like a true philosopher, that the offenses which are committed through desire are more blamable than those which are committed through anger. For he who is excited by anger seems to turn away from reason with a certain pain and unconscious contraction; but he who offends through desire, being overpowered by pleasure, seems to be in a manner more intemperate and more womanish in his offences. Rightly then, and in a way worthy of philosophy, he said that the offence which is committed with pleasure is more blamable than that which is committed with pain; and on the whole the one is more like a person who has been first wronged and through pain is compelled to be angry; but the other is moved by his own impulse to do wrong, being carried toward doing something by desire.\n\n\n11. Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have no concern about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of providence? But in truth they have put all the means in man’s power to enable him to fall into real evils. And as to the rest, if there was anything evil, they would have provided for this also, that it should be altogether in a man’s power not to fall into it. Now that which does not make a man worse, how can it make a man’s life worse? But neither through ignorance, nor having the knowledge, but not the power to guard against or correct these things, is it possible that the nature of the universe has overlooked them; nor is it possible that it has made so great a mistake, either through want of power or want of skill, that good and evil should happen indiscriminately to the good and the bad. But death certainly, and life, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, all these things equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil.\n\n\n12. How quickly all things disappear, in the universe the bodies themselves, but in time the remembrance of them; what is the nature of all sensible things, and particularly those which attract with the bait of pleasure or terrify with pain, or are noised abroad by vapoury fame; how worthless, and contemptible, and sordid, and perishable, and dead they are all this it is the part of the intellectual faculty to observe. To observe too who these are whose opinions and voices give reputation; what death is, and the fact that, if a man looks at it in itself, and by the abstractive power of reflection resolves into their parts all the things which present themselves to the imagination in it, he will then consider it to be nothing else than an operation of nature, he is a child. This, however, is not only an operation of nature, but is also a thing which conduces to the purposes of nature. To observe too how near man comes to the deity, and by what part of him, and when this part of man is so disposed.\n\n\n13. Nothing is more wretched than a man who traverses everything in a round, and pries into the things beneath the earth, as the poet says, and seeks by conjecture what is in the minds of his neighbours, without perceiving that it is sufficient to attend to the daemon within him, and to reverence it sincerely. And reverence of the daemon consists in keeping it pure from passion and thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction with what comes from gods and men. For the things from the gods merit veneration for their excellence; and the things from men should be dear to us by reason of kinship; and sometimes even, in a manner, they move our pity by reason of men’s ignorance of good and bad; this defect being not less than that which deprives us of the power of distinguishing things that are white and black.\n\n\n14. Though thou shouldst be going to live three thousand years, and as many times ten thousand years, still remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses. The longest and shortest are thus brought to the same. For the present is the same to all, though what perishes is not the same; and so that which is lost appears to be a mere moment. For a man cannot lose either the past or the future: for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him? These two things then thou must bear in mind; the one, that all things from eternity are of like forms and come around in a circle, and that it makes no difference whether a man shall see the same things during a hundred years or two hundred, or an infinite time; and the second, that the longest liver and he who will die soonest lose just the same. For the present is the only thing of which a man can be deprived, if it is true that this is the only thing which he has, and that a man cannot lose a thing if he has it not.\n\n\n15. Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Monimus is manifest: and manifest too is the use of what is said, if a man receives what may be got out of it as far as it is true.\n\n\n16. The soul of man does violence to itself, first of all, when it becomes an abscess and, as it were, a tumor on the universe, so far as it can. For to be vexed at anything which happens is a separation of ourselves from nature, in some part of which the natures of all other things are contained. In the next place, the soul does violence to itself when it turns away from any man, or even moves toward him with the intention of injuring, such as are the souls of those who are angry. In the third place, the soul does violence to itself when it is overpowered by pleasure or pain. Fourthly, when it plays a part, and does or says anything insincerely and untruly. Fifthly when it allows any act of its own and any movement to be without an aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without considering what it is, it being the right that even the smallest things to be done with reference to an end; and the end of rational animals is to follow the reason and the law of the most ancient city and polity.\n\n\n17. Of human life the time is a point, and the substance is a flux, and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject to putrefaction, and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine, and fame a thing devoid of judgment. And, to say all in a word, everything which belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul is a dream and vapour, and life is a warfare and a stranger’s sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion. What then is that which is able to conduct a man? One thing and only one, philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without a purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man’s doing or not doing anything; and besides, accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which every living being is compounded. But if there is no harm to the elements themselves in each continually changing into another, why should a man have any apprehensions about the change and dissolution of all the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according to nature.\n\n\nThis in Caruntum.\n\n\n\n\nBack to Western Civilization Reading List",

A portion of his work was written while he was positioned at \nAquincum\n on campaign in \nPannonia\n, because internal notes reveal that the first book was written when he was campaigning against the \nQuadi\n on the river Granova (modern-day \nHron\n in \nSlovakia\n) and the second book was written at \nCarnuntum\n.\n\nIt is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published. The work has no official title, so \"Meditations\" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure and themes\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nRuins of the ancient city of \nAquincum\n, in modern Hungary – one of the sites where Marcus Aurelius worked on \nMeditations\n.\n\n\nThe \nMeditations\n is divided into 12 books that chronicle different periods of Aurelius' life. The passages in each book are not necessarily in chronological order, seeing as they were written as Aurelius' own personal musings. The style of writing that permeates the text is one that is simplified, straightforward, and perhaps reflecting Aurelius' \nStoic\n perspective.\n\n\nA central theme to \nMeditations\n is the importance of analyzing one's judgment of self and others and developing a cosmic perspective:\n[\n3\n]\nYou have the power to strip away many superfluous troubles located wholly in your judgment, and to possess a large room for yourself embracing in thought the whole cosmos, to consider everlasting time, to think of the rapid change in the parts of each thing, of how short it is from birth until dissolution, and how the void before birth and that after dissolution are equally infinite. \nAurelius advocates finding one's place in the universe and sees that everything came from nature, and so everything shall return to it in due time. Another strong theme is of maintaining focus and to be without distraction all the while maintaining strong ethical principles such as \"Being a good man.\"\n[\n4\n]\n\n\nHis Stoic ideas often involve avoiding indulgence in sensory affections, a skill which will free a man from the pains and pleasures of the material world. He claims that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him. An internal orderly and rational nature, or \nlogos\n,\n permeates and guides all existence. \nRationality\n and \nclear-mindedness\n allow one to live in harmony with the \nlogos\n. This allows one to rise above faulty perceptions of \"good\" and \"bad\"—things out of your control like fame and wealth are (unlike things in your control) irrelevant and neither good nor bad.\n\n\n\nTextual history\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe early history of the \nMeditations\n is unknown, and its earliest clear mention by another writer dates from the early 10th century.\n[\n5\n]\n The historian \nHerodian\n, writing in the mid-3rd century, makes mention of Marcus' literary legacy, saying \"He was concerned with all aspects of excellence, and in his love of ancient literature he was second to no man, Roman or Greek; this is evident from all his sayings and writings which have come down to us\", a passage which may refer to the \nMeditations\n. The \nHistoria Augusta\n'\ns biography of \nAvidius Cassius\n, thought to have been written in the 4th century, records that before Marcus set out on the \nMarcomannic Wars\n, he was asked to publish his \nPrecepts of Philosophy\n in case something should befall him, but he instead \"for three days discussed the books of his \nExhortations\n one after the other\".\n[\n6\n]\n A doubtful mention is made by the orator \nThemistius\n in about 364 C.E. In an address to the emperor \nValens\n, \nOn Brotherly Love\n, he says: \"You do not need the exhortations (\nGreek\n: \nπαραγγέλματα\n) of Marcus.\"\n[\n7\n]\n Another possible reference is in the collection of Greek poems known as the \nPalatine Anthology\n, a work dating to the 10th century but containing much earlier material. The anthology contains an epigram dedicated to \"the Book of Marcus\". It has been proposed that this epigram was written by the \nByzantine\n scholar \nTheophylact Simocatta\n in the 7th century.\n[\n8\n]\n\n\nThe first direct mention of the work comes from \nArethas of Caesarea\n (c. 860–935), a bishop who was a great collector of manuscripts.\n[\n9\n]\n At some date before 907 he sent a volume of the \nMeditations\n to Demetrius, \nArchbishop of Heracleia\n [\nit\n]\n, with a letter saying: \"I have had for some time an old copy of the Emperor Marcus' most profitable book, so old indeed that it is altogether falling to pieces.… This I have had copied and am able to hand down to posterity in its new dress.\"\n[\n10\n]\n Arethas also mentions the work in marginal notes (\nscholia\n) to books by \nLucian\n and \nDio Chrysostom\n where he refers to passages in the \"Treatise to Himself\" (\nGreek\n: \nτὰ εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἠθικά\n), and it was this title which the book bore in the manuscript from which the first printed edition was made in the 16th century.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n Arethas' own copy has now vanished, but it is thought to be the likely ancestor of the surviving manuscripts.\n[\n10\n]\n\n\nThe next mention of the \nMeditations\n is in the \nSuda\n lexicon published in the late 10th century.\n[\n11\n]\n The \nSuda\n calls the work \"a directing (\nGreek\n: \nἀγωγή\n) of his own life by Marcus the Emperor in twelve books,\"\n[\n12\n]\n which is the first mention of a division of the work into twelve books.\n[\n11\n]\n The \nSuda\n makes use of some thirty quotations taken from books I, III, IV, V, IX, and XI.\n[\n12\n]\n\n\nAround 1150, \nJohn Tzetzes\n, a grammarian of Constantinople, quotes passages from Books IV and V attributing them to Marcus.\n[\n12\n]\n About 200 years later \nNicephorus Callistus\n (c. 1295–1360) in his \nEcclesiastical History\n writes that \"Marcus Antoninus composed a book for the education of his son Marcus [i.e. \nCommodus\n], full of all worldly (\nGreek\n: \nκοσμικῆς\n) experience and instruction.\"\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\n The \nMeditations\n is thereafter quoted in many Greek compilations from the 14th to 16th centuries.\n[\n13\n]\n This, specifically after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, as it was among the Greek texts reintroduced by fleeing scholars to European intellectual circles.\n[\n14\n]\n\n\nWilhelm Holzmann (Xylander)\n first translated the Meditations into Latin in 1558.\n\n\n\nManuscripts\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nXylander Latin edition (1558)\n\n\nThe present-day text is based almost entirely upon two manuscripts. One is the \nCodex Palatinus\n (P), also known as the \nCodex Toxitanus\n (T), that was first published in 1558–59 but is now lost.\n[\n15\n]\n The other manuscript is the \nCodex Vaticanus 1950\n (A) in the \nVatican Library\n.\n[\n15\n]\n\n\n\n\nCodex Palatinus\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe modern history of the \nMeditations\n dates from the issue of the first printed edition (\neditio princeps\n) by \nWilhelm Xylander\n in 1558 or 1559.\n[\n16\n]\n It was published at the instigation of \nConrad Gesner\n and printed by his cousin Andreas Gesner at \nZürich\n.\n[\n16\n]\n The book was bound with a work by \nMarinus\n (\nProclus vel De Felicitate\n, also a first edition).\n[\n16\n]\n To the \nMeditations\n was added a Latin translation by Xylander who also included brief notes.\n[\n16\n]\n Conrad Gesner stated in his dedicatory letter that he \"received the books of Marcus from the gifted poet \nMichael Toxites\n from the library of \nOtto Heinrich, Prince Palatine\n\", i.e. from the collection at \nHeidelberg University\n.\n[\n16\n]\n The importance of this edition of the \nMeditations\n is that the manuscript from which it was printed is now lost, so that it is one of the two principal sources of all modern texts.\n[\n16\n]\n\n\n\n\nCodex Vaticanus Graecus 1950\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe \nCodex Vaticanus Graecus 1950\n is contained in a codex which passed to the \nVatican Library\n from the collection of \nStefano Gradi\n in 1683.\n[\n17\n]\n This is a 14th-century manuscript which survives in a very corrupt state, and about forty-two lines have dropped out by accidental omissions.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n18\n]\n\n\n\n\nOther manuscripts\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nOther manuscripts are of little independent value for reconstructing the text.\n[\n19\n]\n The main ones are the \nCodex Darmstadtinus 2773\n (D) with 112 extracts from books I–IX, and the \nCodex Parisinus 319\n (C) with 29 extracts from Books I–IV.\n[\n15\n]\n\n\n\n\nReception\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius has been lauded for his capacity \"to write down what was in his heart just as it was, not obscured by any consciousness of the presence of listeners or any striving after effect.\" \nGilbert Murray\n compares the work to \nJean-Jacques Rousseau's\n \nConfessions\n and \nSt. Augustine's\n \nConfessions\n. Though Murray criticizes Marcus for the \"harshness and plainness of his literary style\", he finds in his \nMeditations\n \"as much intensity of feeling...as in most of the nobler modern books of religion, only [with] a sterner power controlling it.\" \"People fail to understand Marcus,\" he writes, \"not because of his lack of self-expression, but because it is hard for most men to breathe at that intense height of spiritual life, or, at least, to breathe soberly.\"\n[\n20\n]\n\n\nRees (1992) calls the \nMeditations\n \"unendingly moving and inspiring,\" but does not offer them up as works of original philosophy.\n[\n21\n]\n \nBertrand Russell\n found them contradictory and inconsistent, evidence of a \"tired age\" where \"even real goods lose their savour.\" Using Marcus as an example of greater \nStoic\n philosophy, he found the Stoic ethical philosophy to contain an element of \"\nsour grapes\n.\" \"We can't be happy, but we can be good; let us therefore pretend that, so long as we are good, it doesn't matter being unhappy.\"\n[\n22\n]\n Both Russell and Rees find an element of Marcus' Stoic philosophy in the philosophical system of \nImmanuel Kant\n.\n[\n21\n]\n[\n22\n]\n\n\nIn the Introduction to his 1964 translation of \nMeditations\n, the Anglican priest \nMaxwell Staniforth\n discussed the profound impact of \nStoicism\n on \nChristianity\n.\n[\n23\n]\n \nMichael Grant\n called Marcus Aurelius \"the noblest of all the men who, by sheer intelligence and force of character, have prized and achieved goodness for its own sake and not for any reward.\"\n[\n24\n]\n Gregory Hays' translation of \nMeditations\n for \nThe Modern Library\n made \nThe Washington Post\n'\ns bestseller list for two weeks in 2002.\n[\n25\n]\n\n\nWen Jiabao\n, the former Prime Minister of China, has said that he has read the \nMeditations\n a hundred times. He also stated that he was \"very deeply impressed\" by the work.\n[\n26\n]\n It has been described as \"a favorite\" of former United States President \nBill Clinton\n.\n[\n27\n]\n\n\n\n\nSelect quotations\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\"Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered\"\n\n\nA little flesh, a little breath, and a Reason to rule all – that is myself.\n— \nII. 2, trans. \nMaxwell Staniforth\n\n\nBe like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds; it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet.

Gregory Hays\n\n\nNot to feel exasperated or defeated or despondent because your days aren't packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human—however imperfectly—and fully embrace the pursuit you've embarked on.\n— \nV. 9, trans. Gregory Hays\n\n\nLet opinion be taken away, and no man will think himself wronged. If no man shall think himself wronged, then is there no more any such thing as wrong.\n— \nIV. 7, trans. \nMéric Casaubon\n\n\nTake away your opinion, and there is taken away the complaint, [...] Take away the complaint, [...] and the hurt is gone\n— \nIV. 7, trans. George Long\n\n\nShame on the soul, to falter on the road of life while the body still perseveres.\n— \nVI. 29, trans. Maxwell Staniforth\n\n\nWhatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together: your own existence and the things that happen to you.\n— \nV. 8, trans. Gregory Hays\n\n\nIn your actions, don't procrastinate. In your conversations, don't confuse. In your thoughts, don't wander. In your soul, don't be passive or aggressive. In your life, don't be all about business.\n— \nVIII. 51\n[\n29\n]\n: 209 \n\n\n[Before making a decision] The first thing to do – don't get worked up. For everything happens according to the nature of all things, and in a short time you'll be nobody and nowhere even as the great emperors \nHadrian\n and \nAugustus\n are now. The next thing to do – consider carefully the task at hand for what it is, while remembering that your purpose is to be a good human being. Get straight to doing what nature requires of you, and speak as you see most just and fitting – with kindness, modesty, and sincerity.\n— \nVIII. 5\n[\n29\n]\n: 162 \n\n\nWhat if someone despises me? Let me see to it. But I will see to it that I won't be found doing or saying anything contemptible. What if someone hates me? Let me see to that. But I will see to it that I'm kind and good-natured to all, and prepared to show even the hater where they went wrong. Not in a critical way, or to show off my patience, but genuinely and usefully.\n— \nXI. 13\n[\n29\n]\n: 179 \n\n\nDo not act as if thou wert going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in thy power, be good.\n— \nIV. 17, trans. George Long\n\n\nOf the life of man the duration is but a point.\n— \nII. 17, trans. C.R. Haines\n\n\nA person who doesn't know what the universe is doesn't know who they are. A person who doesn't know their purpose in life doesn't know who they are or what the universe is. A person who doesn't know any of these things doesn't know why they are here. So what to make of people who seek or avoid the praise of those who have no knowledge of where or who they are?\n— \nVIII. 52\n[\n29\n]\n: 14 \n\n\nOften injustice lies in what you aren't doing, not only in what you are doing.\n— \nIX. 5\n[\n29\n]\n: 223209 \n\n\nWhenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it's nothing to be ashamed of and that it can't degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good. And in most cases you should be helped by the saying of \nEpicurus\n, that pain is never unbearable or unending, so you can remember these limits and not add to them in your imagination. Remember too that many common annoyances are pain in disguise, such as sleepiness, fever and loss of appetite. When they start to get you down, tell yourself you are giving in to pain.\n— \nVII. 64\n[\n29\n]\n: 280 \n\n\nEnough of this miserable, whining life. Stop monkeying around! Why are you troubled? What’s new here? What’s so confounding? The one responsible? Take a good look. Or just the matter itself? Then look at that. There’s nothing else to look at. And as far as the gods go, by now you could try being more straightforward and kind. It’s the same, whether you’ve examined these things for a hundred years, or only three.\n— \nIX. 37\n[\n29\n]\n: 205 \n\n\nKeep this thought handy when you feel a bit of rage coming on – it isn't manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are more human, and therefore manlier. A real person doesn't give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance – unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.\n— \nXI 18.5b\n[\n29\n]\n: 41 \n\n\nDon't tell yourself anything more than what the initial impressions report. It's been reported to you that someone is speaking badly about you. This is the report – the report wasn't that you've been harmed. I see that my son is sick – but not that his life is at risk. So always stay within your first impressions, and don't add to them in your head – this way nothing can happen to you.\n— \nVIII. 49\n[\n29\n]\n: 238 \n\n\nDrama, combat, terror, numbness, and subservience – every day these things wipe out your sacred principles, whenever your mind entertains them uncritically or lets them slip in.\n— \nX. 9\n[\n30\n]\n\n\nI'm constantly amazed by how easily we love ourselves above all others, yet we put more stock in the opinions of others than in our own estimation of self....How much credence we give to the opinions our peers have of us and how little to our very own!\n— \nXII. 4\n[\n29\n]\n: 160 \n\n\nDoes the light of a lamp shine and keep its glow until its fuel is spent? Why shouldn't your truth, justice, and self-control shine until you are extinguished?\n— \nXII. 15\n[\n29\n]\n: 294 \n\n\nWords that everyone once used are now obsolete, and so are the men whose names were once on everyone's lips: \nCamillus\n, Caeso, \nVolesus\n, Dentatus, and to a lesser degree Scipio and Cato, and yes, even \nAugustus\n, \nHadrian\n, and \nAntoninus\n are less spoken of now than they were in their own days. For all things fade away, become the stuff of legend, and are soon buried in oblivion. Mind you, this is true only for those who blazed once like bright stars in the firmament, but for the rest, as soon as a few clods of earth cover their corpses, they are 'out of sight, out of mind.' In the end, what would you gain from everlasting remembrance? Absolutely nothing. So what is left worth living for? This alone: justice in thought, goodness in action, speech that cannot deceive, and a disposition glad of whatever comes, welcoming it as necessary, as familiar, as flowing from the same source and fountain as yourself.\n— \nIV. 33, trans. Scot and David Hicks\n\n\nDo not then consider life a thing of any value.  For look at the immensity of time behind thee, and to the time which is before thee, another boundless space.  In this infinity then what is the difference between him who lives three days and him who lives three generations?\n— \nIV. 50, trans. George Long\n\n\nAll things are interwoven with one another; a sacred bond unites them; there is scarcely one thing that is isolated from another. Everything is coordinated, everything works together in giving form to one universe. The world-order is a unity made up of multiplicity: God is one, pervading all things; all being is one, all law is one (namely, the common reason which all thinking persons possess) and all truth is one– if, as we believe, there can be but one path to perfection for beings that are alike in kind and reason.\n— \nVII. 9, trans. Maxwell Staniforth\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius wrote the following about Severus (a person who is not clearly identifiable according to the footnote): \nThrough him [...] I became acquainted with the conception of a community based on equality and freedom of speech for all, and of a monarchy concerned primarily to uphold the liberty of the subject.\n— \nI. 14, trans.

In a way, it seems, he wrote them to nerve himself for his \ndaunting\n responsibilities. Strikingly, though they \ncomprise\n the innermost thoughts of a Roman, the \nMeditations\n were written in ancient Greek—to such an extent had the union of \ncultures\n become a reality. In many ages these thoughts have been admired; the modern age, however, is more likely to be struck by the pathology of them, their mixture of priggishness and \nhysteria\n. Marcus was forever proposing to himself unattainable goals of conduct, forever contemplating the triviality, brutishness, and transience of the physical world and of humanity in general and himself in particular; otherworldly, yet believing in no other world, he was therefore tied to duty and service with no hope, even of everlasting fame, to sustain him. Sickly all through his life and probably plagued with a chronic \nulcer\n, he took daily doses of a drug; the suggestion has been made that the apocalyptic imagery of passages in the \nMeditations\n betrays the \naddict\n. More certain and more important is the point that Marcus’s anxieties reflect, in an exaggerated manner, the \nethos\n of his age.\n\n\nThe \nMeditations\n, the thoughts of a \nphilosopher king\n, have been considered by many generations one of the great books of all times. Although they are Marcus’s own thoughts, they are not original. They are basically the \nmoral\n tenets of Stoicism, learned from his earlier study of the \nDiatribai\n (\nDiscourses\n) of \nEpictetus\n, a religious former \nslave\n and an important moral philosopher of the \nStoic\n school. The \nMeditations\n thus exhibit the beliefs that the cosmos is a unity governed by an intelligence; that the human \nsoul\n is a part of that divine intelligence; and that the soul can therefore stand, if naked and alone, at least pure and undefiled, amid \nchaos\n and futility. According to some interpreters, Marcus’s references to the soul indicate a movement away from Stoic physicalism and toward a \nPlatonic\n \nmind-body dualism\n. Other scholars argue to the contrary that Marcus’s descriptions represent only a loose application of Platonic-style dualistic language. In any event, Marcus did not deviate so far from Stoicism as to accept the comfort of any kind of survival after death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\n\nAn Odyssey of Grecian Literature\n\n\n\n\n \nJohn Anthony Crook\n \nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica",

    "content": "Fronto’s epistolary agenda in relation to Marcus Aurelius is perhaps more similar to Pliny’s\nagenda than to Cicero’s.  While Cicero clearly is fighting for his political career, jostling for a\nposition as the adviser to Pompey/Caesar, Pliny less urgently benefits from imperial approval\nas the appointed governor of Bithynia. Likewise Fronto’s goals are less urgent than Cicero’s.\nFronto is concerned with his legacy as the personal tutor of rhetoric to a future emperor and\nthe extent to which that emperor’s speeches and edicts will reflect his instruction and his\ninterest in good Latinity,1\n and he constructs images of Marcus accordingly.  This is not to say\n\n\n\n\nthat Fronto never attempts to influence Marcus’ actions as emperor,2\n but it is to his\n\n\n\n\nappointment as the imperial rhetoric tutor that he owes the beginning of his career as a\ncourtier and, therefore, his social status depends upon his personal relationship with the\nimperial family.3\n\n\n\nAs suggested in the previous chapter, Fronto’s correspondence with Marcus Aurelius\nis in many ways most directly comparable with Pliny’s Book 10: we have both sides of the\nexchange, and are in a position to examine how both correspondents manage the \nI\n-\nYou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 \nThe focus of Fronto’s rhetorical instruction, as it comes down to us in his correspondence, is style, and he\n\nnever discusses the technical aspects of oratory: invention, arrangement, memory or delivery; see Kennedy\n1972: 600; Russell 1990: 13-17. He based his theory of style on finding the ‘right’ words to express one’s\nthought, but readers have recognized Fronto’s attraction to old Latin words and have identified his theory as\narchaism.  Many see Fronto as a leader of this movement, which was concerned with reviving the Latin of\nthe Republic, against the tide of degeneration during the Silver Age; see Brock 1911: 32; Russell 1990: 13-\n14; Leeman 1963: 365; Haines 1919(i): xl.  Marache 1952 drew a distinction between Latin archaism and\nwhat was happening in the Greek Second Sophistic, a classicizing movement interested in a pure Atticism.\nCameron 1984: 43-44 suggests that the archaistic movement was the result of a combination of factors\ninternal and external (i.e. the influence of the Greek Atticist movement).  But the picture of an archaistic\nmovement, which parallels the Atticist movement during the second century AD (see, e.g. Brock 1911: 24),\nhas been challenged by scholars  who point out that these ‘archaizers’ created  new words more than dredged\nup old ones (Swain 2004: 17), that much of their language is not attested in the Republic or in the first\ncentury of the Empire (Holford-Strevens 2003: 363) and that Fronto and Gellius advocate the substitution of\nunsuitable archaisms with common expressions (Garcea and Lomanto 2004: 43). Swain 2004: 17 suggests\nthat it might be better ‘to see these second-century authors as linguistic nationalists whose aim was to\nreinvigorate Latin as a language that was capable of change and innovation but also rightly proud of its\nancient pedigree’; cf. Kennedy 1972: 597; Holford-Strevens 2003: 357; Leeman 1963: 371; Goodyear 1982:\n677.\n\n\n\n2 \ne.g. \nAnt\n. 2.1-2.2 (95-96); see n. 149.  All references to the text are followed by the page and line numbers in\n\nvan den Hout’s edition in brackets.\n\n\n\nepistolary discourse;4\n Fronto and Marcus use paraphrase and quotation of the addressee as a\n\n\n\n\nmeans of defining the addressee; the correspondence is arranged in pairs, eliminating the\ninterval between letter and response by the exclusion of dates and maximizing narrative\ncontinuity.5\n  The editor has structured the correspondence in such a way as to project the\n\n\n\n\nimage of an ongoing conversation, just as Pliny’s editor did.6\n  Indeed, the differences between\n\n\n\n\nthe epistolary agendas of Fronto and Pliny are all the more striking for the similarities in the\nconfiguration of their correspondences with their respective emperors.\n\n\n\nWhile Pliny was primarily confirming the ‘reality’ of the ideal Trajan, Fronto is\nattempting to make his ideal a reality; like Cicero and Symmachus, Fronto (using his identity\nas orator) attempts to persuade his addressee to accept his ideal definitions of sender and\naddressee, in this case the ideal \nmagister \nand the ideal orator-emperor.  Likewise, while Trajan\noften was confirming Pliny’s ideal definitions and mirroring them back in his replies, Marcus\nconsistently redefines sender and addressee, shifting the basis of discussion from eloquence to\nStoicism.  What makes Fronto unique among our letter writers, though, is the nature of his\nrelationship with his emperor.  Unlike the others, Fronto is able to fall back on a previous\nposition of some authority over Marcus, as his former rhetoric tutor; it is his status as\n\n\n\nmagister\n with which he attempts to maintain influence over the emperor, his former student.\nOur understanding of the relationship between Fronto and his imperial pupil has\nchanged in recent years; E. Champlin nicely summarizes the traditional view: ‘upon his\nappointment as tutor, Fronto quickly won his pupil’s love and thoroughly instructed him in\nthe art of Latin rhetoric; but in the course of the 140s the young prince was converted to\nphilosophy, to Fronto’s dismay and over his protests; and thereafter, although personal\nrelations remained warm, Fronto never won back the earlier intimacy and authority’.7\n  Indeed\n\n\n\n\nmany scholars go so far as to say that Fronto harboured ‘hatred of philosophy and all its\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 \nFor a general discussion on epistolary \nI\n-\nYou\n discourse see Introduction, p. 4.\n\n\n\n\n5 \nFor a general discussion of arrangement and its role in creating continuity or discontinuity in a letter\n\ncollection, see ch. 3, pp. 100-101; on the chronology of Fronto’s epistolary collection see n. 39.\n6 \nSee Haines 1919(i): ix-xxii.  The original editor is unknown, but one possibility is Fronto’s son-in-law,\n\n\n\n\nAufidius Victorinus, who was Fronto’s heir and a leading man during the reign of Commodus, putting him\nin a favourable position to be the literary executor.  His goal may have been to bring Fronto into prominence\nas Marcus Aurelius’ tutor, and to put on record his view on oratorical and literary style.\n\n\n\n7 \nChamplin 1980: 121.  All dates in this chapter are \n\n\n\n\nworks’,8\n and that for him ‘a philosopher on the throne was a disaster’.\n9\n    Likewise these\n\n\n\n\nscholars generally position Marcus at the opposite extreme, pointing to \nad M. Caesarem\n 4.13,\na letter in which Marcus admits that he has been neglecting his rhetorical exercises in order to\nread Ariston (identified as the third century BC Stoic), as evidence of Marcus’ final break with\nrhetoric.10\n  These scholars have built up the picture of a disagreement between the emperor\n\n\n\n\nMarcus and his former tutor about the merits of philosophy, in which Fronto desperately\nattacks it, and Marcus largely ignores him.\n\n\n\n Others have argued that this picture must be redrawn.  Champlin questions the value\nof \nad M. Caesarem\n 4.13 as evidence of a sudden and complete conversion to philosophy,11\n\n\n\nand points out that there is also evidence for Marcus’ abiding interest in literature and\neloquence and for his being known as an accomplished orator as well as a philosopher.12\n  E.\n\n\n\n\nRawson questions the appropriateness of labelling Marcus the ‘philosopher-king’,13\n noting\n\n\n\n\nthat his philosophy tutor, Rusticus, was also a Roman aristocrat14\n and that in the \nMeditations\n\n\n\n\nMarcus voices suspicion that claimants to the role of philosopher-king were play-acting.15\n  In\n\n\n\n\nany case, as emperor, Marcus had no choice but to make use of oratory in his public speaking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 \nBrock 1911: 39; see Brock 1911: 78-84, chapter eight, ‘Fronto’s Opposition to Philosophy’.\n\n\n\n\n9 \nvan den Hout 1999: ix; cf. Leeman 1963: 366; Kennedy 1972: 600-601; Haines 1919(i): xxxiii-xxxiv;\n\nMackail 1913: 235.\n\n\n\n10 \nvan den Hout 1999: 186; Karadimas 1996: 18; Kennedy 1972: 600; Haines 1919(i): xxxiv; Brock 1911: 52.\n\n11 \nChamplin 1974: 144 argues that Ariston should be identified with the jurist Titius Ariston, which would\n\n\n\n\nbetter suit the context of the letter and in particular the statement that ‘the laws must sometimes be allowed\nto sleep’ (4.13.3 [68,8-9]). Birley 1987: 226 accepts Champlin’s argument that the letter does not represent a\nsudden conversion, but argues that it is clear that Marcus is suffering an inner crisis.  See Moles 1978 for\nparallel supposed ‘conversions’ from rhetoric to philosophy, especially Dio Chrysostom; Moles points out\nthe dangers in conversion-analysis and argues that in Dio’s case, conversion is not supported by the facts of\nhis career.\n\n\n\n12 \nD.C. 71.1.1-3; Hdn. 1.2.3; Aur. Vict. \nCaes\n. 16.1; \nEpit\n. 16.7; Champlin 1980: 121-122; see also Rawson\n\n1989: 255.\n\n\n\n13 \nRawson 1989, exploring the extent to which Greeks attempted to persuade Roman emperors to take\n\nphilosophical advisers, concludes that while Romans were familiar with the notion of the philosophic ruler\nand adviser, many of them were not terribly interested in these ideas (1989: 255); on the tendency from the\ntime of the Second Sophistic to equip ‘good’ emperors of the past with such an adviser, see Murray 1965;\nChamplin 1980: 121-122 points out that the image of Marcus as philosopher-king was fastened upon by\nsubsequent generations, but was not so overwhelming for his contemporaries.  See also Stanton 1969 who,\nafter an examination of the legislation enacted during Marcus’ reign, concludes (against Noyen 1954 and\n1955) that he did not apply his philosophical beliefs as emperor.\n\n\n\n14 \nRawson 1989: 252; on Rusticus see also Champlin 1980: 119f; Brock 1911: 52-55; D.C. 71.35.\n\n15 \nRawson 1989: 252; Aur. \nMed\n. 9.29.  Themistius assigns, along with Rusticus, Epictetus as philosophic\n\n\n\n\nadviser to Marcus (Themist. 5.63d).  However, Marcus clearly never knew Epictetus personally, while by his\nown account read and valued his works (see Rawson 1989: 251).  On Marcus’ own devotion to philosophy,\nsee D.C. 71.1; SHA \nM. Ant\n. 1.1; 2.6; 8.3; 16.5; \nAvidius  Cassius\n 1.8; 3.5-6; 14.5.\n\n\n\nand is not likely to have completely rejected the teaching of his rhetoric tutor.  Champlin sees\nin the post-accession letters evidence of Fronto reassuring an anxious emperor, who lacks\nconfidence in his own oratorical abilities.16\n\n\n\nFronto, for his part, according to D. Karadimas, recognizes the value of philosophy in\nthat it produces great thoughts, to which one may put eloquent words, and urges Marcus to\ndignify his philosophical thinking with equally great speech.17\n  Fronto’s disappointment with\n\n\n\n\nhis student lies in a difference in priorities: Fronto would have Marcus reverse the order in\nwhich philosophy and oratory received his attention rather than demand an abandonment of\nphilosophy altogether.  Aware of his former student’s preference for philosophy, Fronto\ntakes a conciliatory stance, in which moderation between the two possible extremes is\nadvocated.18\n\n\n\nWhat evidence is there then of the debate between rhetoric and philosophy in Fronto’s\ncorrespondence with Marcus Aurelius?  In the letters written before Marcus’ accession,\nChamplin, having discounted \nad M.Caesarem\n 4.13, sees very little indeed: ‘we are left with a\ncorrespondence between Fronto and Caesar Marcus which reveals almost no concern for the\nperils and attractions of philosophy: Fronto’s skirmishes with the discipline are confined to\nletters and essays composed in his old age and after Marcus’ accession as emperor’.19\n\n\n\nWithout the ‘conversion’ letter, what appears to remain is only \nad M.Caesarem\n 3.16, in\nwhich Fronto explicitly defends rhetoric against Marcus’ opinion that it is dishonest.20\n\n\n\nAs for letters exchanged after Marcus became emperor, there is a small group, in which\nFronto lays out his theory of style, that contain his attacks, such as they are, on philosophy.\nThese include the book entitled \nde Eloquentia\n (five letters in M. P. J. van den Hout’s edition)\nand one entitled \nde Orationibus\n.  Marcus makes no explicit statement against rhetoric in any\nof his letters addressed to Fronto during this period.21\n  Evidence for his position is therefore\n\n\n\n\ntaken from his \nMeditations\n, written after his exchange with Fronto, or deduced from Fronto’s\n\n\n\n      \n16 \nChamplin 1980: 125; cf. Brock 1911: 53.\n\n17 \nKaradimas 1996: 13, 17; cf. Champlin 1980: 123.\n\n18 \nKaradimas 1996: 16-17.\n\n19 \nChamplin 1980: 121; cf. Goodyear 1982: 677.\n\n20 \nChamplin 1980: 174 n. 19.\n\n\n\n\narguments (i.e. Marcus’ opinion is thought to be in opposition to them) and from Fronto’s\nrepresentation of the emperor’s state of mind.  In other words, scholars have looked outside\nthe letters written by Marcus himself for evidence of his opinion, in some cases trusting\nFronto to provide an accurate representation.22\n\n\n\nThere appears to be little evidence at all for the debate between philosophy and\nrhetoric in Fronto’s correspondence, especially in the letters exchanged with Caesar Marcus.\nHowever, while scholars have rightly come to adopt a more moderate view of the positions\ntaken by the two correspondents on this topic, they have failed to recognize that these\npositions are in fact evident throughout their exchange.  As we have seen, the act of writing a\nletter is an act of self-definition, which also affords the opportunity of defining the self to\nwhich one is addressed.  In this correspondence, as in Pliny’s Book 10, we are able to observe\nan exchange of selves between the correspondents, but of a different sort than the exchange\nbetween Pliny and Trajan.  The exchange between Fronto and Marcus is presented by the\ncorrespondents as a game, whereby each (re-)creates \npersonae\n for sender and addressee, often\nexplicitly within the context of a joke.  This game manifests itself in the choices of the\n\n\n\ncorrespondents within the epistolary form.\n\n\n\nThe focus of both Fronto and Marcus’ shaping and reshaping of selves is the\nrelationship between them, and each accomplishes his fashionings by using strategies of\nepistolary discourse to define himself in relation to the other and vice versa.  Before Marcus’\naccession, Fronto (\nI\n) the teacher addresses Marcus (\nYou\n) his student within their teacher-\nstudent relationship.  In turn the student redefines himself as Marcus (\nI\n) the Stoic addressing\nFronto (\nYou\n) as something other than his teacher (e.g. his friend/lover) within the context of\nStoicism.  This picture changes after Marcus becomes emperor, when Marcus (\nI\n) the busy\nemperor writes Fronto (\nYou\n) his teacher, a pair of selves that does not naturally fit into either\nthe exchange between Stoic friends or between a student and his tutor.  In turn Fronto (\nI\n)\ntakes up his role as teacher and addresses Marcus (\nYou\n) his student, reasserting his \nauctoritas\n\n\n\n\nas \nmagister\n and re-establishing eloquence as the foundation of their relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in chapter two, the self-fashioning attempted by Cicero goes on beneath\nthe surface of some fiction; he says one thing while doing another.  This model is in some\nways analogous to the notion of ‘code-switching’, defined as ‘the practice of using two or\nmore languages in the same utterance’,23\n which S. Swain has developed in his examinations of\n\n\n\n\nGreek in Cicero and Fronto’s correspondence.24\n  He identifies two codes in which Fronto and\n\n\n\n\nMarcus speak to each other: profuse expressions of love or friendship, and problems of\nhealth.25\n  He offers a reading of the Greek erotic letter (\nAddit. epist\n. 8), sent from Fronto to\n\n\n\n\nMarcus, and reveals the political realities obscured by the code, in which the tutor-pupil\nrelationship is overshadowed by the client-prince relationship.26\n  As in Cicero’s\n\n\n\n\ncorrespondence, a different linguistic register is used to discuss an awkward topic.\n\n\n\nSwain’s interest is the sender’s choice of language: ‘Language choice ... is often bound\nup with the identity which a person is seeking to project on a particular occasion ...’27\n  When\n\n\n\n\nit comes to the epistolary form in particular, the choice of letter type is similarly connected to\nthe self-projection of the sender.  The sender’s \npersona\n is determined, in part, by the type of\nletter he is sending; one addresses oneself to the recipient of a letter of consolation in very\ndifferent terms than to the recipient of a love-letter,28\n and a different letter form, like a\n\n\n\n\ndifferent linguistic register, may be used to discuss an awkward topic.\n\n\n\nFor our purposes then, ‘code’ may be (re)defined as letter type: Cicero’s political self-\nfashioning is obscured by the letter of consolation or the letter of recommendation.  And it is\nby means of the conventions or coded language of, for example, the forensic letter or the love-\nletter that Fronto and Marcus conduct their playful exchange of selves.  But these codes also\nobscure a corrective agenda and a struggle to control the \npersonae\n of sender and addressee:\nFronto attempts to influence the emperor and his priorities (i.e. to persuade him to put\nrhetoric before or at least alongside philosophy), and Marcus puts his (former) tutor back in\nhis proper place in relation to the emperor.  The debate between rhetoric and philosophy, as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23 \nAdams and Swain 2002: 2.\n\n\n\n\n24 \nOn Cicero see Swain 2002; on Fronto see Swain 2004: 17-28.\n\n25 \nSwain 2004: 19.\n\n\n\n\n26 \nSwain 2004: 20-21.\n\n27\n Adams and Swain 2002: 2.\n\n\n\n\n28 \nPseudo Demetrius and Pseudo Libanius each identifies several letter types (21 and 41 respectively) according\n\nto their style;  see Malherbe 1988: 30-41 and 67-81.\n\n\n\nwell as the political realities of the relationship between correspondents, is lurking behind\ndiscussions about something very different.\n\n\n\nIt is on letters in which this coded language is employed by the correspondents that I\nshall focus my attention in this chapter, letters in which the conflict between rhetoric and\nphilosophy is obscured by an unrelated topic: first, those concerning sleep, in which each\ncorrespondent uses forensic rhetoric to argue either for or against its usefulness (for or against\na Stoic approach to sleep/eloquence); and secondly, letters dealing with illness and health, in\nwhich the correspondents explore the letter’s capacity for either bridging or increasing the\ndistance between sender and addressee and their ideal Stoic or eloquent selves.  These are\nletters that have usually been read at face-value, but as in Cicero’s correspondence, the\nsender’s corrective agenda is discernible upon closer inspection.29\n\n\n\nTo Sleep or not to Sleep\n\n\n\n\nThe Stoics included sleep in the category of things to be enjoyed once justice had been done to\nserious and weighty business.30\n  Cicero explains that if sleep did not provide necessary rest\n\n\n\n\nfor the body, it would be considered \ncontra naturam\n (because it robs us of our senses and\nsuspends our activity), and we would happily deny ourselves sleep almost to the point of\ndoing violence to nature for the sake of business or of study.31\n  All in all the Stoics recognize\n\n\n\n\nthe necessity of sleep for survival,32\n but advocate getting only the minimum necessary, in\n\n\n\n\nfavour of devotion to work, to self-evaluation and especially to philosophy.\n\n\n\nOver the course of their epistolary exchange, Fronto repeatedly expresses concern\nabout Marcus’ sleeping habits.  Seventeen letters contain some reference to sleep and/or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29 \nThere are some similarities between my approach to Fronto’s letters and that of A. Freisenbruch, who deals,\n\nin the second chapter of her 2004 PhD thesis (a summary of Fronto’s correspondence), with the epistolary\nand pedagogical relationship between  Fronto and Marcus, exploring the power dynamics involved in the\neducation of the prince.  She also approaches the letters from the perspective of epistolarity.  But my thesis is\ndistinguished from hers especially by its comparative perspective.

Introduction\nMany books claim to be life-changing, but this is a rare one that actually is. Marcus Aurelius was a stoic philosopher and the greatest emperor of Rome, and we can see how great he was by the sheer amount of challenges that he had to overcome. In the north, a barbarian horde had broken through the frontiers and pushed all the way to northern Italy. His own general in the east, in Egypt, rebelled, and he had to deal with all of this, while one of the worst plagues in antiquity ravaged his population. Rome should not have survived the second century, but because of Marcus, it not only survived, but it thrived. Marcus led his troops from victory to victory, he stabilized imperial politics, and he extended the \nPax Romana\n against all odds.\nAnd the crazy thing is, that's not even close to what's most impressive about the guy. The most impressive thing about Marcus is that he faced all of these challenges with a Zen-like inner peace. And the exciting promise of this book is that you can be like Marcus too. His resilience, his tranquility, his ability to deal with challenges effectively can be yours. The stoic ideal is not the purview of a chosen elect, but available to all rational beings. But there's just one problem, which is that this book isn't an instruction manual you can just apply to your life. In fact, it's not even a book at all. Meditations are a series of diary entries that Marcus wrote while he was fighting on the front lines. What it contains are nuggets of wisdom, but not his full philosophical worldview.\nSo I think it's very tempting to pick up the Meditations because of how accessible it is to read a paragraph and think you got it. But Stoicism is not pithy one-liners. It's not just getting a \nMemento Mori\n tattoo and calling it a day. The core of stoic practice is about inducing a systematic change in your perspective. That philosophical perspective is the key to unlocking the value of this work for your life, and what we will cover in this lecture today. In the next two hours, we're going to go through a condensed version of the education Marcus himself would have received from his imperial tutors, so that you too can learn to see the world like the stoic emperor.\nBefore I read the \nMeditations,\n and I thought stoic, what came to my mind was this stern dad figure. Okay, he gets up every day at 5 AM, he does his ice bath, and then his powerlifting routine, and then he grinds through the rest of his day like an absolute machine. You're pretty sure he loves you? You're pretty sure. He takes care of your family, he doesn't cheat on your mom, but you're not sure. He's never said it, he sure as hell never showed it, and don't get me wrong, it's not like he's a bad guy, it's simply that you wouldn't want to have him over for dinner too often, because he's a bit boring, he's emotionless, he doesn't seem to care.\nThis is a common critique I think people have of Stoicism, which is that the stoics don't care, even when they should, and they cite this one line as proof. I quote you Marcus:\nWhen you kiss your child goodnight you should say silently: “Tomorrow, perhaps, you will meet your death.”\n(Marcus Aurelius, \nMeditations\n)\nNow, the common reaction to that quote is to say, what kind of Mormon wisdom is this. Right? Even if I could stop caring about my kids, even if that would make me happier, that's not a worthy trade-off.\nThe first thing I'll say in defense of Marcus is that whatever this is, this is not Marcus talking out of his ass. Marcus Aurelius had 13 kids, seven of them died before they reached adulthood, and he had to deal with each of their passing while putting out fires in the empire.\nThat's what's so incredible about this work, which is that Marcus doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk, and I want you guys to keep that in mind, especially once he starts to say the crazy stuff later on in the lecture. Here's the second thing I'll say, which is that this critique of Stoicism is based off of a detachment, not caring about things, is based off of a misconception, and I can begin to tease out what's missed by peeling back to that very quote, because people only pay attention to the second half of the quote. Right? Tomorrow perhaps you will meet your death, but what they ignore is the first half, when you kiss your child goodnight.\nWhat people miss is the gentle kiss. It's the clear care, it's the legitimate love that has formed this tender nightly ritual. That is as much a part of Stoicism as the harsh anticipation on death. So it's not so much that this stern detached dad character is wrong as it's simply incomplete, because Stoicism is not just about strength and resilience, but also about love and gentleness and care, and above all, it's about a deep engagement with the world. But when you put it that way, the term sheet the Stoics are handing us seems almost too good to be true. You can have the happiness of a monk while maintaining in the world, you can rear a family, you can have great wealth and power, you can be emperor if you want to, you don't have to retreat from the world, because the Stoics will teach you how to retreat into yourself.\nKeep reading with a 7-day free trial\nSubscribe to \nJohnathan Bi\n to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free access to the full post archives.\nStart trial\nAlready a paid subscriber? \nSign in\nPrevious\nNext",

    "content": "Dalton (\n00:01\n)\n\nWelcome to Venture Step Podcasts where we discuss entrepreneurship, industry trends, and the occasional book review. Today, we're taking a trip back in time to ancient Rome for a conversation with one of history's most powerful figures, Marcus Aurelius. The emperor and philosopher left behind a treasure trove of personal writings, we will be discussing Gregory Hayes' translation of Marcus's book, Meditations. Before we dive in, I'm your host,\n\n\nDalton. I've got a bit of a mix of background in programming, data science and insurance offline. You can find me building my side business running or lost in a good book. You can listen to the podcast and video or audio format on Spotify, YouTube. If audio is more your thing, you can find the podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever it's good. Your podcast today will be discussing meditations, a book not meant for\n\n\npublication, but for personal reflection. Meditations was Marcus Aurelius' personal journal that was discovered by historians. When I say historians, I mean way back when, not present day historians, and it was preserved and it's been translated into many different languages. Marcus Aurelius, it was the Roman emperor from\n\n\n161 to 180 AD. His reign was marked or soiled by wars and plagues, but is still considered part of the Pax Roma period, which was a period of heightened Roman power and stability and had a relatively considered peaceful.\n\n\ntime period?\n\n\nUnlike many emperors, Marcus Aurelius sided with Stoicism to delve, or not delve, but deal with his issues that he had and the weight that was to be a ruler of Rome and the weight of being one of the most powerful people in history and at that time, one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n\nAnd during his reign, talked about these external threats and internal social pressures that had a burden on him. And it definitely shows in the writings and certain themes that are talked about. Why does his writings resonate with people today? I think struggle is timeless. There's...\n\n\na gap between centuries between when you're reading it now and when Marcus wrote those things in his journal, but they still have meaning. It's about being human, exploring who you are, finding meaning in yourself, handling stress, dealing with difficult people, and seeking inner peace. And a lot of those things people see,\n\n\nand feel today, especially dealing with difficult people. I know that there's people at work that that are difficult for it seems to you no reason and you just have to deal with it and however way you deal with it, it affects your mood. So that might help you out. But those things and especially him being an emperor, he. Isn't an emperor in these books, he's just a person writing down his.\n\n\nAnd so there's like this humanity aspect that people normally wouldn't see as a world leader. World leaders don't have self -doubt. They don't seek self -improvement. They're kind of put on this pedestal by the media and for the right reasons, because if your leader has issues, then it shows weakness with your country. So it's just.\n\n\nreally cool to see someone of that stature and society and during that time period be dealing with all these things that we would consider human.\n\n\nWhat is discussed in the book is practical. There's no abstract ideas. It's just, it's providing a tool to live a better life. And, and I think that would be universally appealing to many readers. Marcus Aurelius' Meditations book has many translations, but I chose Gregory Hayes' translation simply because it's\n\n\nreadability, it's modern English, it still preserves the essence as...\n\n\nGregory Hayes has a scholarly reputation. He is a respected classic scholar and a professor. It's gotten many endorsements. It's a popular translation because it's been endorsed by famous stoics slash entrepreneurs like Tim Ferriss or Ryan Holiday. And so,\n\n\nThere's also that piece where there's many people reading Gregory Hayes and for the right reasons and it makes it relatable and it's endorsed by people that might already live in that space. I read Ryan Holiday's book, The Daily Stoic, and this is one of the next books that I wanted to read simply because Ryan Holiday talks about it so much. There's so many leaders that talk about this book.\n\n\nthat they'd say, oh, I read it every day, or not every day, or I read it every year. I carry it around with me every day in my pocket just to remind me to stay on task and live with discipline and honor and virtue and not let things that I don't control bother me and seek inner peace.\n\n\nWhen we talk about the book Meditations, it's got a different format than the Daily Stoic. And how I would describe the Daily Stoic versus the Meditations is the Daily Stoic kind of has a hand on your back and kind of guides you through the process where you read one page per day. And then there's a section of what you read that's from some famous philosopher,\n\n\nAnd then there is a snippet slash historical references below where it might say, okay.\n\n\nSinica wrote this during this time and there was this war going on or, you know, Marcus Aurelius, blah, blah, blah, had issues with his partner. And that's why he wrote that. Or there might be additional context to help you anchor in those words and etch them into your mind. There's also things where it has information related to\n\n\nrecent presidents or leaders or famous entrepreneurs and business owners where they might have additional contacts to.\n\n\ngive you...\n\n\nI mean, I don't want to say additional context, so many times in a row, like three times in one sentence, but it just gives you that that extra punch on what you're reading. So you kind of get a one to whereas, you know, the Daily Stokes, you kind of get a combo. But the meditations, there is no hand on your back. It's kind of a nonlinear, short, but powerful passages that either could be a couple of pages, could be a quarter of a page.\n\n\ncould be two sentences, a sentence, or maybe a couple words. Because it's not meant for publication, it's meant for Marcus. And it's Marcus' journal, and it's his diary, it's his personal thoughts, it's his notes. So they're not for anyone but himself. And there's a beauty in that because some of the stuff that he writes is just...\n\n\nIt's incredible and obviously I'm not the only one who thinks that because it's a famous book and well regarded. But with that in mind, it's just that there is the flow doesn't really flow as much and kind of all over the place. There is some themes to it, but they're kind of loose as they are a.\n\n\na grouping of notes from a journal that's really old that's translated into English. So there is this there is some gaps there. And if you're expecting a page by page flow, something like that, I would think of it as more of like shorthand notes of of instruction that he was given by other philosophers or famous people in his time, things that happened throughout his life and him looking at.\n\n\nretrospectively at X things that were going on or having his own opinion on his previous actions and, and trying to.\n\n\nimprove himself and seeking self -improvement and virtue and peace and being a tool for society, being a productive member and leader, man, Roman, those kind of things. And for one, it's crazy because he is the one of the most powerful people in the world at the time.\n\n\nAnd he is talking about how did I do everything I could to not cause harm, you know, to cause harm depreciates the soul. And am I, you know, doing the right thing and, and am I a good person and, and am I enabling other people, am I correcting people in a graceful manner? Am I accepting the lessons of my mistakes and all these things instead of being arrogant and\n\n\nand things that he could be doing that he doesn't do. Cause there's no one checkmaking, checking him like, Hey, Marcus, how, how about you settled out your tone, Marcus or how about you not do this? I mean, there is no one that he's at the top. So, and there's a lot less rules back then, of course. So I think that gives a better perspective on, on.\n\n\nMarcus and his notes and these are just things that he's writing down and you might have to navigate with him while he was navigating Rolling Roll.\n\n\nAnd the core themes of it is related to stoicism, its virtue, duty, and accepting what you can't control.\n\n\nThat being said, I wanted to discuss a couple of quotes that I have from the book and I'll be listing the pages and I'll read the section. There is many. I wanted to pick some that aren't too long and are still powerful.\n\n\nAnd we'll read the quote and then I'll discuss my thoughts about it. I think that you get what it will be, but.\n\n\nSo this one is 550, section 11. It's the pursuit of those things and your attempt to avoid them that leaves you in such turmoil. And yet, they aren't seeking you out. You are the one seeking them. Suspend judgment about them and at once they will lie still and you will be freed from fleeting and pursuing.\n\n\nOkay, so in this, my thoughts are, is that Marcus is discussing and recognizing that our desires and aversions often cause us more inner chaos than the external things themselves. And so while you're emphasizing on the things that bring you suffering, it is giving those external things more power over us.\n\n\nnot the other way around. So it's kind of twofold where you need to accept what is happening to you and deal with them in the best ways you can. But also at the same time, you don't over pursue your desires as it's the same as avoiding your mistakes or issues or suffering that you have going on in your life currently.\n\n\nBeautiful passage.\n\n\nPage 30, section five. This is probably one of my favorite ones besides a famous quote that I didn't do because it's so famous and so I thought I would do this one instead. How to act.\n\n\nNever under compulsion, out of selflessness, without forethought, with misgivings. Don't gussy up your thoughts, no surplus words, or unnecessary actions. Let the spirit in you represent a man, a citizen, a Roman, a ruler. Take up his post like a soldier, impatiently waiting for his recall from life, needing no oath or witness.\n\n\nwithout requiring the help or serenity supplied by others. To straighten up. To stand up straightened.\n\n\nTo stand up straight and not strain. Sorry about that.\n\n\ncaught myself. So Marcus Aurelius is outlining his code of conduct for himself and emphasizing inner strength, clarity and purpose. And he's recognizing his values that he has, or not values, but his roles that he has in society. And so in his life and in other people's lives. So in other people's lives, he's a man, he's a citizen.\n\n\nHe's a citizen of Rome and he's also a ruler. And so he's saying, you know, take, take your station and wherever station you have and fulfill it to your fullest as a good soldier would. And so he's saying, I'm going to be the best man. I'm going to be the best citizen that I can be. I'm going to be the best Roman. I'm going to be an awesome ruler because that, that is, that is my role that I have. And I'll be.\n\n\ncompleting that role to the best of my abilities until I die. And doing so without any oath, without anyone witnessing what I'm doing, he's going to take care of what needs to be done without supervision. And that's one of the big things is do, what is it, like is it, do what needs to be done without.\n\n\nanyone watching. And that's kind of what Marcus is talking about is, you know, be cheerful without others bringing you up, you know, be the light of the room. Stand, stand, stand strong and your responsibilities and your duty in society. And don't, don't be strained by the things that give you purpose, I would say.\n\n\nOut of those two quotes, which quote resonated with you the most? I think that they're both phenomenal and definitely crazy thing to write in your journal. I think that's a classic for sure to just be outputting consistently in your journal. Once you read the whole book of what like 180 pages of just amazing pieces of text. It is.\n\n\nIt really is something else. When you think about it that way where it's not something that was intentional and is something that just came about, it is crazy. It's crazy in its own right. One thing that is important and was talked about with the Daily Stoic is that Meditations is not a book that you just read once. It's a book that you revisit and...\n\n\nis not forgotten. So you would have to constantly keep touching and getting in getting touch and feel of meditations and reread the book after certain life experiences, similar to the daily stoic where like if you have a kid or you get married or you know, an unfortunate event happens, you get laid off, you get a new job, a new challenge in your life. That's when you will pick up that book and you'll be looking for guidance and\n\n\nthat book will be your lighthouse kind of thing.\n\n\nAnd Marcus Aurelius' meditations has been something that you can incorporate in your life like many great leaders have and you can follow in their footsteps. I'm just going to name a couple. Frederick the Great, King of Persia used to carry a copy of meditations with him on his war campaigns. Theodore Roosevelt brought\n\n\nthe Marcus Aurelius' Meditations on his River of Doubt expedition, which was one year on the river, I'm pretty sure. I forgot what river, I think it was in South America in the Amazon, I'm pretty sure. Definitely, if I'm wrong, correct me in the comments. Appreciate that. Bill Clinton cited Meditations as one of his favorite books. Tim Ferriss.\n\n\nfrequently discusses his own practices that were inspired by meditations. Several NFL coaches, including Bill Belichick, stated that they use ideas, Stoke ideas from meditations to instill focus and resilience among their players.\n\n\nMeditations is more than just a history book. It offers a practical wisdom for anyone seeking inner peace in a meaningful life where you contribute to society, you accept things that you cannot control, and you find your inner peace with your mind. If your body is in pain,\n\n\nthen that is your body's fault.\n\n\nIf your soul is in pain, then that is yours. It's a quote from the book.\n\n\nparaphrase but that's that's from Marcus Aurelius. So I think you should pick up a copy and let Marcus Aurelius inspire you to find you find your inner peace, find your level of community and if you have any favorite quotes from meditations let me know in the comments.\n\n\non YouTube or Spotify, I'm pretty sure you can do comments. Let me know what your thoughts are. If you've read Meditations and what should I read next, I'm thinking about reading, and I already have it on my bookshelf over there if you're watching on video, is Thinking in Bets by...\n\n\nAnnie Duke. So Annie Duke was a what? PhD think mathematician and then she stumbled on to. Poker and so that's what I read next and so I want to read one book related to kind of philosophy and then one book related to business. So they're kind of balancing out. OK, well have a great weekend and I.\n\n\nAppreciate you. As always, I'll talk to you next week. Bye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreators and Guests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDalton Anderson\n\n\nI like to explore and build stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheadphones\n\n\nListen Anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Options »\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadcast by\n\n\ntransistor logo",

    "content": "HH: It’s that time of the week, the time for the Hillsdale Dialogues. Once a week, I sit down with Dr. Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale College, or one of his colleagues, or both, and we talk about one of the great works of Western Civilization. We began at the beginning of the year with the Iliad. And today, we are up to 160AD, so we’ve come many, many hundreds of years, and to the meditations of Marcus Aurelius. But before I go there, Dr. Arnn, how are you?\n\n\nLA: Well. How are you, Hugh?\n\n\nHH: I’m terrific. I have to say you’ve gone and plucked Matt Spalding from Heritage and carried him away to Michigan.\n\n\nLA: Light work, yeah. It was easy. \n\n\nHH: Why would you have one of the Capital’s greatest Constitutional scholars plucked out of the center of the fray and taken off to this obscure state, which is really barely even a state? It exists only by the, it’s sort of a boon, a grant to the poor people of Canada to not have to deal with Michigan. Why would you do that to Matt Spalding?\n\n\nLA: Well, about Michigan, I’ll say that we really only have one simple task, and we do it always, and we do it easily. We dominate Ohio. But Matt’s going to stay in Washington. He’s going to run our academic programs at our Kirby Center, and we’re doing more teaching there, and we’re going to do a lot more. And we’re going to give a liberal education, including the in founding of America, to the people in that city where it is nearly absent. And Matt is a great guy to lead that effort.\n\n\nHH: Oh, that is a terrific idea. I did not see that. So though you are plucking him into the Hillsdale family, you will allow him to continue his very important work inside of the Beltway.\n\n\nLA: Yeah, and you know, he’s been in Washington a long time. He may be too ignorant to actually move back to Hillsdale. \n\n\nHH: To live among the trees. My second non-Marcus Aurelius question has to do with the movie which I doubt very much that you have seen, Steve Jobs, as played by Ashton Kutcher. Have you seen this movie?\n\n\nLA: I have not.\n\n\nHH: Well, he comes off, and again, this is just a, I have not read the Walter Isaacson biography of Jobs, and so I don’t know whether it is an accurate portrayal. But if it is, Jobs was an angry, bitter, selfish, back-biting, back-stabbing, terrible human being and repulsive, though of course, a design genius and responsible for two of the devices sitting in front of me. And so obviously a flawed, but somewhat genius man. But as I was driving home from this with my son, I said you know, I’ve been covering Plutarch with Larry Arnn, and it occurs to me that Plutarch found no time for men of business or engineers or artists in his Lives. Why was that?\n\n\nLA: Well, because those things are mechanical, and Plutarch was interested in people who dealt  with the higher things, including the highest. And the highest is not politics. It’s what Cicero dealt with, politics as they emerge into philosophy, the ultimate ends for which we live our lives, and politics’ concern with that. Politics has a duty to protect our connection to those things. And so I want to say something about Steve Jobs, because I’m an Apple guy, and fancy, I know a fair amount about him. And I think he, first of all, I think he was a very worthy human being, especially toward the end of his life. Did you know he banned pornography from the App Store? He did it himself personally. \n\n\nHH: I did not.\n\n\nLA: And he once answered an email. He would make these little emails once in a while to customers, and they would make national news when he did it. And somebody said Apple is for freedom, and do whatever you want. Why are you doing that? And Jobs replied, if you had children, you would understand. And so, and the rough edges on the man were very great. And he was abusive of people often. On the other hand, that changed over time, and he became much less so. And the people working with him became like a band of brothers. And they still remember him with great respect, and he was not abusive to them. He was an incredibly insistent man, and very insightful, but he stopped being such an abusive man, I believe. And one of the criticisms of this movie is that they don’t show that.\n\n\nHH: No, they don’t. It ends off, it leaves off in 2002. But what called to mind in the third book of the twelve books of Marcus Aurelius, about which more, the emperor writes, “Never value anything as profitable to thyself which shall compel thee to break thy promise, to lose they self-respect, to hate any man, to suspect, to curse, to act the hypocrite, to desire anything which needs walls and curtains. For he who has preferred to everything intelligence and the worship of its excellence acts no tragic part, does not groan, will not need neither solitude nor much company,” and it continues in that vein, very inconsistent with at least his early days.\n\n\nLA: Yeah, that’s right. And you know, he, first of all, this book that we’re about to read, is different in kind, I think, than any book that we will read. I can’t think of another. And the reason is a very great reason, and that is this book should be your friend and companion for life from the first moment you begin reading it. It’s a very unusual book. I don’t know anything else like it, as I say. And it is immediately available. You should be able to benefit from this book in the first five minutes you attend to it.\n\n\nHH: That is true, and it’s also, it’s written in an extraordinarily accessible fashion, unlike some of the books that we have worked our way through. You can go to any of the twelve books and dive right in. I want to go to the first one, but first, tell people a little bit about Marcus Aurelius. \n\n\nLA: Well, Marcus Aurelius was the last of the five good emperors. And you know, emperors come because, beginning with Julius Caesar, but also on the way to there, because of Sulla, the tyrant and conqueror, Rome had been this republic, this balanced regime, in which the Senate and the people of Rome were one thing, and they were an organism. And they each had their powers, and they played against each other. And what happened was various strong men, especially Julius Caesar, and later Augustus, conquered and broke everybody. And they did that by the artful and subtle device of killing tens of thousands of people with soldiers. And Rome was never the same after that. Some people think well, Rome was corrupted by its luxury and stuff like that. The truth is the conquerors killed a lot of people, including Cicero, whom we read last week. Well, after that, Rome was different. And the good emperors were five people who came along in order, one after the other, and what they did was they were the boss now. And what they said went, but they treated the Senate with great respect. And they attempted to rule moderately. And that chain breaks with Marcus Aurelius, who was a very great man, by his son, Commodus. And see, one of the things that happens among these five good emperors is that two, or I may be forgetting, maybe there were three, who were actually not the eldest son of the emperor, and didn’t succeed that way. They were adopted by the emperor in part because they had demonstrated some excellence. And Marcus Aurelius was one of those. Commodus, who followed him, was his eldest son, and proved to be a frightful man. And in fact, in that movie, Gladiator, which is a very good movie, although not true, but partly true, Commodus actually murders his father to get the job.\n\n\nHH: Yes.\n\n\nLA: And that didn’t happen. But Marcus Aurelius is that guy. And Rome is at its peak of extent, and he rules for, what, 20 years, I think?\n\n\nHH: Yeah, 19 years, yeah.\n\n\nLA: And in that 20 years, he was, Rome was very rich. And it was very powerful. And it didn’t really grow under him, but it kept what it had, which was nearly everything. And it was coming under financial stress, because they were subsidizing people so much, kind of a familiar story today. And they had those guys who would eventually destroy Western Rome, the Germans. And you know, Germany is this bunch of forest and hills, and it’s very tough. And of his 19 years, Marcus Aurelius spent 13 of them in border wars up by Germany. So he was a good ruler, and he was a very successful ruler, and his rule was constantly troubled, and often miserable.\n\n\nHH: And at the same time that he did this, long period of war, he would take out his pen. And the Meditations was not, I think it was not, written for public consumption, correct?\n\n\nLA: Well, that’s the thing. You should understand what you’re reading, because as I say, I don’t know anything like it. It isn’t a diary. It is written privately to Marcus Aurelius himself. But it’s not dear diary, here’s how I feel today, and here’s what happened today. It isn’t that. What it is, is a reminder to himself that often has the tone of commands to himself about the way things are and how he should behave. And they have the tone, constantly, of, sometimes they’re beautiful reflections on the nature of things. But most continuously, very often through them, what they are is statements to himself – you must behave this way and not be miserable.\n\n\nHH: Do you teach this at Hillsdale?\n\n\nLA: Oh, yeah.\n\n\nHH: When we come back, we’ll find out when, and to what effect. \n\n\n— – – – \n\n\nHH: So Dr. Arnn, when do you teach it and how do you teach it at Hillsdale?\n\n\nLA: Well, it’s in our history reader in the freshman core. And we are changing our core right now. We’re making it bigger, and so not everybody will be taking this class in the freshman year. Right now, almost all do. But it tends to be freshman-sophomore year, and it’s in a book of readings that’s published, edited and published by the college, done by our History Department. And we do an extract from the book. \n\n\nHH: And which, do you recall, of the twelve books of the Meditations, do you most heavily rely on? Or do you dance about and grab this and that?\n\n\nLA: Let me see. I have it right here. Let me see if I can, if we do it in a way so I can tell what books it’s from. It’s hard to say. It looks like it’s scattered about. \n\n\nHH: Well, then, let me begin at the beginning with just a few, sort of a touch. He opens with a long list of gratitudes, a long list of thank you’s. “From my grandfather, Verus, I learned good morals and the government of my temper. From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. From my mother, piety and beneficence and abstinence not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts, and further simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.” And it continues on for a dozen paragraphs in this vein.\n\n\nLA: That’s…and think of that for a minute. It’s like everything else. First of all, this is a man who had teachers, and they were wise, and he is grateful to them. And this is a man who in his youth is adopted by the emperor, Antoninus, and marked out to be first, second, and then first in the line of succession. And when he succeeded, he immediately appointed another relation to be his co-emperor, and that relation died pretty soon. But he was, he was preparing himself to exercise the greatest power in the world. And his teachers taught him that there’s a right way to do that and a wrong way to do that. And it doesn’t matter what you prefer with your power. You must use it well. \n\n\nHH: I also noted in reading up on his biography, he had many children who died, and he refers to this early on in the Meditations as being something he could not effect, so he chose not to allow it to affect him. That seems hard to imagine.\n\n\nLA: Yeah, and there were so many things in his life like that. He developed a way of looking at the world that meant that his own death was palatable to him, and that he must approach life as a man in tune with nature and reason. And so it’s not that it didn’t affect him. This book is evidence that things affected him powerfully. The book is written so that he may manage the effects properly. \n\n\nHH: Now at one point, he writes about his religious belief. “To the gods, I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good. Further, I owe it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offense against any of them, though I had a disposition which if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something of this kind.” That’s an unusual way to write about the forces above and beyond you.\n\n\nLA: That’s…and it’s, if you parse it out, it’s a statement of humility, gratitude and obligation, you see. In other words, he’s been placed in this place. It’s a station. And it’s a station full of trouble. And doubtless, when he first became the emperor, and it was thrilling to him, he had to combat that thrill. He writes this book. You know, and there’s a lot about this we don’t know, by the way. We call it the Meditations, but he didn’t give it a title. Why would he? He’s writing it to himself. The way in which the book comes to us is odd, because there were nine centuries that passed after his death until it emerged. And it emerges in a letter from a Christian saint to another friend, and the way he composes the letter conveying the book gives one the impression that people know about this book, and people regard it as a great good. But that means it had been circulating for a while. But the earliest evidence we have of it is eight nor nine centuries after Marcus dies. It survived all that time. And that’s, and these are his notes to himself, right? He had no plan that we know of to do anything with it. And it’s not written. It’s written as you would think it was written. Do you ever, I mean, I say to you and the listener, do you write down things, or isolate things that you think are good for you, that you read regularly? \n\n\nHH: I can answer yes to that, because I write books, and I try and put into them those things which most remarkably strike me. Jefferson kept a day book in which he did this repeatedly. I think many people have that practice. I think Churchill had that practice, too, did he not?\n\n\nLA: Oh, yeah, and he had this fantastic memory. Here’s a story about Churchill you’ll like, and this is extremely revealing to me. In 1940, Churchill did, you know, London’s being bombed, he’s giving these speeches, people are trying, people in power are trying to force Britain, in Britain, are trying to force Britain into a negotiated peace. It’s a time of incredible turmoil. And there are reports of Churchill’s magnificent bravery and equanimity. Well then, he says to John Colville, who worked for him one time, he says, there’s a prayer, and the writings of George Borrow, that was said at the Siege of Gibraltar, which is about the time of the American Revolution. He said go find that for me, I want it verbatim. And Churchill had a wonderful memory. Here’s the prayer. I’ve memorized it. He says fear not the result, for either they end will be an enviable and magnificent one, else God will preserve our rain upon the waters. Now Winston Churchill wanted those words to carry around with him all day, you see? And that means he was afraid. \n\n\nHH: Yeah.\n\n\nLA: And he had a way to confront that fear. And that way is the same as this way, in Marcus Aurelius. \n\n\nHH: Now in Chapter, Book Two, it begins, and by the way, do you carry this book with you? Am I right about you telling me that?\n\n\nLA: Yeah, I used to get, back before the e-books, I used to keep, I had a little copy of it, and I took it with me in my briefcase customarily. And now I have it on my Kindle, and I, well, I use the Kindle reader, but I use an iPad – Steve Jobs.\n\n\nHH: I think this first line of Book Two is especially appropriate for a college president. “Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happened to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil.”\n\n\nLA: Well, you know, I have a better life than that. But that’s a good thing to remember.\n\n\nHH: It is a good thing. I’ll be right back.\n\n\n— – – – \n\n\nHH: If you are not yet signed up to receive the Hillsdale monthly speech digest, Imprimus, you can do so for free, absolutely for free, and it’s got a mailing list of, what, a million and a half people, Larry Arnn?\n\n\nLA: 2.7.\n\n\nHH: Okay, I was only off by 1.2 million. 2.7 million people are getting Imprimus every single month, and you can, too, for free, by going to www.hillsdale.edu. And all the Hillsdale Dialogues, every single one of them, are available for free as well, www.hughforhillsdale.com, or there’s a link at hughhewitt.com. If you’re a home schooling mom or dad, it is a great way to introduce you or your children, junior high and high school, to these great works, and then to dive into them. All right, Larry Arnn, he was a stoic. Would you explain to people what stoicism is?\n\n\nLA: Well, first of all, it’s a little controversial whether he was a stoic. But stoic comes from, stoicism comes from, it’s a word for porch, and the first Stoic philosophers sat on porches. And they are a development, you might say, on Socratic or Platonic philosophy. They come to see the world as reasonable, as a nature that makes sense. And they try to fit themselves in that nature. And they think that this, the reason in nature in which one can participate, it’s connected to the idea of the natural law, that this reason and conforming to it is the human capacity and the human work. And so living well means living in accordance with nature. And you will die, and that’s part of your life, and the right disposition to that, and all pains as well as pleasures in it, is governed by this nature and your reason, and not by your wishes. And so it’s, you know, we think of stoicism as, you know, we have the modern word stoic, and that means somebody who’s pretty tough and pretty quiet about it. And their enemies, their main opponents in the world are the epicureans, who thought life is pretty random, and the pleasures that we have in it are natural to us, and we should focus on those. It doesn’t mean living like a Sybarite, just eating chocolates and taking drugs all day. But it does mean that our purpose is to enjoy our higher pleasures. And the Stoics read it a little different. Our higher pleasures must be connected with living rightly under nature, even if that’s painful.\n\n\nHH: So why do you say it is controversial that Marcus Aurelius is a Stoic? \n\n\nLA: Well, he read the Stoics, and he was connected to some of them, but what we have from him is these Meditations. And they’re not exactly a tract of Stoicism. They are much more, as I say, self-commands. And they are very noble and very beautiful. And you know, I’ll read you one of my favorites if you want me to.\n\n\nHH: Please.\n\n\nLA: 3-12, and what, there are chapters, I think there are eight chapters, and therein the chapters are divided into little sections, so in Chapter 3, Section 12, he says, this is like a good thing to read to yourself when you get up for a day and you’ve got a difficult day. And I’ll say something about that. If you lead a really busy life, you know, the curse of my life is that I have too many good things to do. And I never, I don’t have enough time not to be doing them. And that shows something that’s a failure in the human condition, right? I like to say I like all the parts of my job. They just compete with each other for time. \n\n\nHH: Yeah.\n\n\nLA: So get up in the morning this way. If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment, if you can embrace this without fear or expectation, can find fulfillment in what you’re doing now, as nature intended, and in super human truthfulness, every word, every utterance, then your life will be happy. No one can prevent that.” Now that’s a recurring theme to this man, who’s besieged all his life on the frontier, living rough most of the time, and an emperor of the greatest power in the history of the world.\n\n\nHH: Yeah.\n\n\nLA: He is saying that you can be self-sufficient in your happiness. And he’s reminding you of that. And when you read a thing like that, at least for me, it’s bracing. It reminds me that I’m supposed to try to do a good job at each thing, and take my satisfaction from that. And I enjoy it immensely. There’s another place, I’m looking for it. But before I find it, I can tell you what it says. He says people who go off on these vacations and say if I could only get away, you can get away, he says, at any moment. You can get away within. A vacation is always available to you. \n\n\nHH: We’ll come back from break. We’ll continue that conversation. \n\n\n— – – – – \n\n\nHH: “Every moment, think steadily as a Roman, and a man, to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection and freedom and justice. And give thyself relief from all other thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius was one for focus, Larry Arnn. He really was very intent on focus.\n\n\nLA: Very much, and he, one of the things that happens, because you see, and you have think about his life. It’s like your life, except more so, everyone’s life. There are pressures all the time. Things are always going wrong. You have moments of joy. You have moments of fear. You have moments of affliction, right? And his way was to look up from those and locate himself so that those seemed small. And it’s really lovely how he does it. I just enjoy this book immensely. I have from the first time I started reading it. I have certain passages of it that are in my day planner, the one I use on the computer. And I see them every week or so, and it’s just good for me to do it. \n\n\nHH: Do you have any other ones that come to mind that you want to put out there?\n\n\nLA: Yeah, yeah. I’ve got to get my pages done right. \n\n\nHH: It’s radio.\n\n\nLA: “Then what can,” and this is, I think this is in 4-17. Maybe it’s 2-17. I can’t maneuver my book very well. “What then,” he says, “Duration of things is momentary. Nature is changeable. Perception is dim. Condition of body, decaying. Soul spinning around. Fortune unpredictable. Lasting fame, uncertain. What then can guide us? Only philosophy, which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free from assault, superior to pleasure and pain.”  So he makes a list of all of the things that are terrible about human life. And you know, an emperor is supposed to be exempt from those things, like lasting fame? Everybody the man meets treats him like a god. And he doesn’t take that seriously, right? \n\n\nHH: Yeah.\n\n\nLA: The power within. Sometimes, he loves the expression the god within, meaning like we would say today, the divine spark within us. That has to be safe and free from assault.\n\n\nHH: It is very reminiscent of Ecclesiastes. We did not read Ecclesiastes, but vanity is vanity, all is vanity, sayest the preacher. There is so much similar to that in this, and of course, he would not have been, I shouldn’t say it’s certain, but there’s no reason to believe he would have been familiar with ancient Jewish texts.\n\n\nLA: No, but you know, Christianity was about, and so he makes one reference to it here. I can’t…\n\n\nHH: I missed that.\n\n\nLA: I can’t remember the reference. It isn’t important. But you can see a way in which Christianity could arise from Stoicism, because Christianity, you know, what is Jesus’ advice, right? It’s very often look up to God and don’t worry about the things of this Earth. They will take care of themselves. \n\n\nHH: I found it. It’s in the chapter, Book 11, 3rd paragraph. “What a soul that is, which is ready, if at any moment it must be separated from the body and ready either to be extinguished or disbursed, or continue to exist, but so that this readiness comes from a man’s own judgment, not from mere obstinacy as with the Christians, but considerably, and with dignity, and in a way to persuade another without tragic show.” I’m not sure what he means by that, but that was the reference to it.\n\n\nLA: Yeah, and I don’t think, see, the Christians are thought to be at this time…\n\n\nHH: Stubborn.\n\n\nLA: To the Roman, they’re thought to be bigots and atheists, because they won’t accept the gods.\n\n\nHH: Yeah.\n\n\nLA: And to people like him, and it hasn’t become a, you know, Christianity, this is in 170, and what, Constantine accept Christianity in 330, roughly something like that, I think?\n\n\nHH: Yeah, 325, I think, yeah.\n\n\nLA: And so it’s a long way until Christianity becomes a prime subject. And then of course, there’s a lot of persecution before Constantine accepts it. But it isn’t a prime subject with Marcus Aurelius, but there are things in it, as you rightly point out, that are very like it. And that, we might read a little Boethius when we go next, and you’ll see that Boethius is a kind of Stoicism made otherworldly. I mean, it’s very remarkable, the constellations of philosophy.\n\n\nHH: And so with a minute and a half left to our break here. How would you advise someone to go about the Meditations?\n\n\nLA: It’s easy. That’s the great thing about it. It doesn’t matter what order you read it in, although you can read it through. It’s just great. You should just start reading it. Start at the first if you want. It doesn’t matter if you start somewhere else. Mark the passages that you really like, and then if you read it enough, and I urge you to do so, you’ll start to remember them, and they will be of comfort to you.\n\n\nHH: Here is the last one I’ll give you. “Consider when thou art much vexed or grieved, that man’s life is only a moment. And after a short time, we are all laid out dead.” So the Obama presidency’s not that bad.\n\n\nLA: Yeah, “Death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful, and hence neither good nor bad.” \n\n\nHH: But he does not tell you not to do your duty. That’s the interesting tension, Larry Arnn. You can be very fatalistic, but he is at no place a shirker of duty.\n\n\nLA: And also, not fatalistic, really, you see, because the god within you is operating. And your being is made real and full when you act purely in accordance with that. And so to let your desires control you, even wild animals do that, and rutting humans and tyrants, from Phalaris to Nero, in other words, emperors that he repudiates, so it is not just fatalistic, it is also sublime. \n\n\nHH: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.

    "content": "Post published:\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\n\nPost category:\nStoicism Resources\n\n\nPost author:\nAllan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a short commentary on Donald Robertson’s new book, \nMarcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor\n.\n\n\nFrom the book’s description:\n\n\n\n\nThis novel biography brings Marcus Aurelius (121–180 CE) to life for a new generation of readers… as Robertson skillfully weaves together Marcus’s inner journey as a philosopher with the outer events of his life as a Roman emperor.\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to share this as I really enjoyed reading the book and learned a lot about Marcus’s life, from his upbringing to how he dealt with the seemingly endless challenges he faced as emperor.\n\n\nIf you’d like more info in addition to the summary that follows, you can check out my conversation with the author himself here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius\n did not have a heart of stone.\n\n\nThe preceding line is also the very first sentence in \nMarcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor\n, Donald Robertson’s excellent biography of the philosopher-king.\n\n\nBeginning the book like this was clearly a careful consideration on Donald’s part, and it was a very astute one.\n\n\nNot only does the statement reflect the truth of Marcus Aurelius’s individual character—he was known for his warmth, friendship, and affection—but it also immediately dispels for the reader the common misconception that as a general rule, Stoics seek to be cold and unemotional.\n\n\nThe Stoics didn’t ignore or suppress their emotions. Their philosophy did not advocate for the stiff-upper-lip attitude that the modern lower-case word “stoicism” equates to.\n\n\nPhilosophers like Marcus Aurelius knew that they would inevitably feel intense emotions at times. The initial throes of anger, fear, and grief, for example, can strike involuntarily. But they also knew that what they did after these involuntary feelings was what mattered.\n\n\nThere’s no shame in feeling these instinctive reactions; we can’t help it after all.\n\n\nBut we can’t allow ourselves to persist in them. We can’t allow them to cloud our judgment. That’s the voluntary part. Experiencing an intense emotion is one thing, allowing it to guide our thoughts, intentions, and actions is another.\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius knew he had to use philosophy to prevent reason from being usurped by his passions. As Donald Roberston writes:\n\n\n\n\nThe pages of the \nMeditations\n show its writer again and again striving to maintain a rational and brutally honest attitude toward life’s most troubling events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fail in this commitment would have been very dangerous for a man ruling the Roman Empire. He couldn’t afford to respond to every event based on his initial emotional reaction to it—this was the undoing of many an emperor before and after him.\n\n\nIn \nMarcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor\n, we learn about all the troubles Marcus Aurelius faced in his time as emperor—the wars, the plagues, the rebellions, the natural disasters, the deaths of friends and family, and his own poor health.\n\n\nWe could almost forgive him if \ndid\n have a heart of stone.\n\n\nAnd yet the more desperate things got, the more rational his responses seemed to be. He delayed the acceptance of titles and accolades after wars, he held a public auction of imperial treasures to raise funds, he pardoned people who rebelled against him, and he argued for the rights of women, children, and slaves.\n\n\nIf Marcus Aurelius could face what he faced and still preserve his character—still be considered \ngood\n—surely it can inspire us to maintain a rational and brutally honest attitude toward our own troubles.\n\n\nThen, like true Stoics, we can understand and deal with our emotions instead of ignoring and suppressing them.\n\n\nDonald Robertson also gives us a full picture not only of how Marcus preserved his character, but how it was built in the first place.\n\n\nThe background of his upbringing is vital in this regard. From key tutors like Junius Rusticus and Fronto to essential role models like his mother and his adoptive father, Antoninus Pius, they all had a part to play in shaping the future Stoic emperor.\n\n\nKnowing the people Marcus was surrounded by and how they influenced him, we get a clear understanding of what made him the person he turned out to be.\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor \nis a biography, but it’s also an inspiring tale of the resilience that can result from adopting philosophy as a way of life. We learn about a philosopher-emperor. We learn about the events of his life, his birth, his death, his friends, family, and enemies.\n\n\nBut with every detail, we also learn something about Marcus Aurelius’s character because Donald Robertson gives us what we’re really after when we read any book: what can help us in our own lives.\n\n\nIn this case, that’s an account of how Marcus Aurelius responded to and interacted with all the events and people in his life.\n\n\nIt’s for this reason that reading this book is worth your time and, as Cassius Dio summarizes perfectly in his Roman History, why we’re still impressed with this historical figure almost 2,000 years since he took his last breath:\n\n\n\n\nHe did not meet with the good fortune he deserved, for he was not strong in body and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign. But for my part, I admire him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself and preserved the empire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Share This\n\n\nShare this content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpens in a new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 21-Day Daily Stoic Freedom Challenge – Day 15 – Do It Now: Solve One Nagging Problem\n\n\n\n\nJuly 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspiring Examples of Stoic Leadership\n\n\n\n\nApril 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Stoicism Is NOT: The School Of Isolation\n\n\n\n\nJuly 24, 2021",

    "content": "Blog\n \n\n\n100 (More) Lessons From 100 (More) Reads of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, I bought my first copy of the \nMeditations\n of Marcus Aurelius. I was 19 years old. I didn’t know who Marcus Aurelius was (besides the old guy in Gladiator), and I certainly didn’t know whether it would be the right translation or not. I suppose it was luck that I got the Gregory Hays translation—though the Stoics would say it was fated—but what arrived would change my life. \n\n\nMarcus was clearly fond of the philosopher Heraclitus (he quotes him a lot), who said that we never step in the same river twice. Because we are always changing. It’s equally true that we never read the same book twice—because while the contents don’t change, \nwe\n do. Our circumstances change. The world changes.\n\n\nI still have that first copy of \nMeditations\n. The cover is taped back on. Every page is marked or folded. Nearly every passage has something noted or underlined. I’m technically what Stephen Marche calls a “centireader”—reading Marcus Aurelius well over one hundred times—but actually, I’ve never read the same \nMeditations\n twice. Each time, I notice new things. A passage I highlighted before now strikes me for a different reason. A line that once seemed irrelevant to my life suddenly describes something I’m going through perfectly. Something I thought I understood turns out to seemingly mean something else entirely. \n\n\nSo I’m constantly re-reading Marcus Aurelius’ \nMeditations\n. Most recently, I pulled out my original copy after I received a kind of mind-blowing request. Modern Library, publisher of the Gregory Hays translation, was getting ready to put out a new edition, and they asked if I would want to write a foreword for it. \nWrite a foreword to the very translation that so changed my life?\n “Of course,” I said, “it would be beyond an honor.” \n\n\nWith the release of this new Modern Library edition (\nyou can buy that here\n), I wanted to share 100 more (\ncheck out the first 100 lessons here\n, or \nwatch the video on YouTube\n) things I’ve learned in nearly twenty years with what is, without a doubt, one of the most incredible books ever written.\n\n\nBut before we get into that…I’m answering all your questions about \nMeditations\n in a live Q&A on April 26th as a companion to \nHow To Read Meditations: A Daily Stoic Guide\n. Get the guide before April 26th (Marcus Aurelius’ 1905th birthday) to receive your invite. \nSign up here\n, or learn more in the P.S. \n\n\n[*] One of the most interesting things you come to understand about \nMeditations\n is how unoriginal it is. Marcus is largely cycling through and recycling the insights of the some 500 years of Stoic philosophy that preceded him. On one page, we see him borrowing a metaphor from Panaetius. On others, he’s quoting Epictetus from memory or riffing on something he heard from Rusticus. This isn’t something bad. It’s actually quite beautiful. \nMeditations\n is not an individual work but a collective work—he is a product of all the Stoics that came before him. As we all are today.\n\n\n[*] Of course, Stoicism feels old to us. Seneca lived 20 centuries ago, and Cato was born in 95 BC. As Marcus writes in \nMeditations\n, the names, dates, and places feel distant and unfamiliar with time’s passing. Who can even pronounce Chrysippus? Who remembers Athenodorus or Arius? From our perch in the 21st century, not many. And yet, as Marcus himself noted, Stoicism was already ancient in his time. Nearly 400 years separated him from Zeno. Ten emperors came and went between Nero and Marcus. Generations of Stoics read, discussed, translated, and preserved these ideas. ‘Ancient’ isn’t a fixed label—it’s a process, like entropy, acting on everything. We’re all becoming ancient. What’s new now will one day feel as distant as Marcus does to us.\n\n\n[*] I seem to remember my copy arriving right away after I purchased it, but searching my email for the order number as I wrote the Foreword, I found an angry customer service ticket, where teenager me was angrily complaining about a few days’ shipping delay. How badly I needed the words I would find in Book 6 of \nMeditations\n! “You don’t have to turn this into something. It doesn’t have to upset you.”\n\n\n[*] Marcus opens \nMeditations\n by reflecting on what he learned from influential individuals in his life. Titled “Debts and Lessons,” the 17 entries span nine pages and over 2,000 words—nearly 10% of the entire book! Marcus writes with the humility of someone in the final act of life, taking stock of how lucky he is. It’s beautiful, and it dispels the myth of the “self-made man.” Marcus knew he was the product of mentors, influencers, advisors, and teachers. “Debt” is the operative word—he owed them so much. The same is true for us: we are shaped by our influences, environments, families, and friends. Success (or failure) is always a collaborative effort.\n\n\n[*] How could Marcus ever repay these people? He couldn’t. What people do for us when we are young, what they teach us, the doors they open for us–this is not something we can pay back. \nWe can only pay it \nforward\n.\n \n\n\n[*] In one of the first passages in \nMeditations\n, Marcus said one of the things he learned from his philosophy teacher Rusticus was “To read attentively—not to be satisfied with “just getting the gist of it.’” Rereading it as I was beginning to work on this article, it struck me that if I’d stopped at “just getting the gist” of \nMeditations\n—if I hadn’t reread it again and again, if I hadn’t carefully read Hays’s peerless introductory remarks or other books and reviews and articles and essays about Marcus—my entire life would have turned out differently. From his great-grandfather, Marcus said he learned to invest in learning “and to accept the resulting costs as money well-spent.”\n\n\n[*] “And,” Marcus writes, adding another thing he learned from Rusticus, “not to fall for every smooth talker.” This is a core Stoic idea. You can’t trust appearances. Epictetus said we have to stop and put every impression to the test, like a money assayer tests if money is counterfeit. We have to be smart, alert to scammers, fraudsters, and con artists. We have to put every smooth talker to the test.\n\n\n[*] From early Stoics like Thrasea, Helvidius, and Cato, Marcus said he learned to believe in a “society of equal laws, governed by equality of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the liberty of their subjects above all else.” Nothing, he believed, was more important or just than that. And yet he ruled a Rome that, in many ways, stood in stark contrast to those ideals. Like Jefferson writing in the Declaration of Independence that “all men are created equal” while owning slaves, Marcus was expressing a powerful ideal. \nIt’s the job of each generation to move closer to that vision\n, to not talk about what a just society looks like—we have that on record—but to help it \nbecome\n one.\n\n\n[*]\n \nWhy do I like the Gregory Hays edition so much? Because it’s alive and accessible. Hays uses clear, modern, plain English—but still captures the power and beauty of Marcus’s writing. There are no “thous,” “shalls,” “thys,” or “thees”—nothing old-fashioned to slow you down. I didn’t realize how important that was until I picked up another translation—probably George Long or A. S. L. Farquharson—online for free. Suddenly, the lyrical book I loved felt dense, boring, unreadable, and hard to connect with. If I’d cheaped out and gone with the free version—again, my entire life would have turned out differently.\n\n\n[*] Hays notes that Marcus never calls himself a Stoic anywhere in \nMeditations\n. \nIf you asked him what he studied, Hays contends, Marcus would likely have answered “philosophy” rather than a specific school. Perhaps Marcus was doing what Epictetus said, don’t talk about your philosophy—don’t tell us your label—\nembody it. \nOr as Marcus put it, “Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.”\n\n\n[*] On the one hand, every translation of \nMeditations\n should feel unreadable—or at least unrelatable. Marcus Aurelius lived nearly nineteen centuries ago, chosen by a dying tyrant to become a god-king, ruling over tens of millions with the power of life and death. He was a high priest of primitive cults, fought brutal wars, buried most of his thirteen children, and wrote in Greek on papyrus for no one but himself. Marcus was not like us at all—how could he have been? \nThe past is a foreign country,\n it has been said, and that is very true. We like to think the Romans were just like us, but they were unfathomably different, as was every other era and civilization. \n\n\n[*] On the other hand, we can tell from \nMeditations\n that Marcus was also just like us. David Hernández de la Fuente, a Spanish classist and translator of Marcus Aurelius, says that the man’s writings reveal a picture of a man with “two voices coexisting: one that doubted and suffered, while the other acted as a teacher, offering comfort and certainties.” Marcus Aurelius was a guy with the same inner dialogue as us, the same struggles as us, the same battles as us. This was a very different man from a very different time…and yet he was still essentially human, still essentially us.\n\n\n[*] It wasn’t until I walked the streets of Acquincum, near Budapest, where Marcus visited the Second Legion and wrote parts of \nMeditations\n, that it hit me: This man was just a man, a guy who walked this same street that I am walking now. \n\n\n[*] It hit me there, too, in Hungary, just how distant Rome was (some 800 miles). “Life is warfare and a journey far from home,” Marcus writes in Book 2. Indeed, for him it literally was. Some twelve years of his life would be spent at the empire’s northern border along the Danube River, fighting long, brutal wars. \n\n\n[*] The fact that Marcus Aurelius was writing during the Antonine plague (a 15 year pandemic that killed between 10 and 18 million people) and that he may well have died of the plague created a different way for me to see and understand what Marcus was writing about. Early on, I was struck by the line, “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think,” but I didn’t fully appreciate that he was talking about that in a time when you really could leave life right now.\n\n\n[*] Realizing that Marcus was writing during a plague also made me realize he doesn’t talk much in \nMeditations\n \nabout said plague. Nowhere does he bemoan the disasters which happened with such frequency that one ancient historian described Marcus Aurelius’ reign as an unending series of troubles. Marcus skips over all this, but you know what he spends a full 10% of \nMeditations\n talking about in very clear detail? The gratitude he felt to the people who had helped him, who had inspired him, who had taught him. It’s a lesson: shrug off the negative and embrace the positive. “Convince yourself that everything is the gift of the gods,” he writes in Book 10, “that things are good and always will be.”\n\n\n[*] Marcus and Nero had strikingly similar beginnings—both lost their fathers young, were told early that supreme power awaited them, and were tutored in Stoic philosophy. So why did Marcus turn out to be Marcus and Nero to be Nero? Why was one brilliant and just, the other vicious and unhinged? I’ve come to believe it was their mothers who made the difference. Nero’s mother was calculating and ambitious, uncaring and cruel. In Book 1, Marcus writes that he often thinks about his mother and when he does, he thinks about…“Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not only to do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the simple way she lived—not in the least like the rich.” \n\n\n[*] Where did Marcus get his profound and lifelong commitment to doing the right thing? To kindness? To charity? To justice? It was from her. “Only one thing is important,” Marcus writes elsewhere in \nMeditations\n. “To behave throughout your life toward the liars and the crooks around you with kindness, honesty and justice.” That was him channeling his mother.\n\n\n[*] When Jerry Seinfeld was out doing the interview circuit to promote his movie, Unfrosted, in just about every interview he talked about “my obsession now…I’m reading a lot of Marcus Aurelius.” \nHe said something I hadn’t really thought of before and have since started imagining when I read Meditations\n: “I love to imagine him in his bedroom there—the leader of the entire world, an emperor, a Roman emperor—saying to himself, ‘Yes, you’re going to talk to a lot of annoying people today? That’s what every day is like. Why are you surprised? People are annoying.’”\n\n\n[*] When Marcus received the news of Hadrian’s plans to have Antoninus Pius adopt him and place him next in line for the throne, he broke down in tears. There was no one he revered more than Antoninus. How could he possibly live up to the task of following in his footsteps? Today, you would say that Marcus was struggling with what we call “imposter syndrome.” As the story goes (which I tell in The Boy Who Would Be King), the night before he was to become emperor, Marcus Aurelius had a dream. In the dream, he found that his shoulders were made of ivory. It was a sign: He was not an imposter. He was not weak. He could do it. And then guess what? He did do it. He—like all of us—had stronger shoulders than he thought.\n\n\n[*] In my first read of \nMeditations\n, I must have read, “It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character.” But COVID created a different way for me to see and understand what Marcus was writing about. When he talks about how there are two kinds of plagues: the plague that can take your life and the plague that can destroy your character — he was talking about the things that we’re seeing in the world, that we saw on a daily basis over the last two years.\n\n\n[*] On early readings, I did not understand all the allusions Marcus made to various Stoic metaphors, or even direct mentions of various Stoic thinkers (which include Chrysippus, Epictetus, Thrasea, Arius Didymus, Helvidius Priscus, and Junius Rusticus). In Book 1, he thanks Rusticus “for introducing me to Epictetus’s lectures—and loaning me his own copy.” One person passing along great and brilliant writing to a friend or a pupil? \nIt’s a beautiful tradition\n, one as old as time.\n\n\n[*] Marcus quotes Epictetus who is himself riffing on Plato, to remind us that “against their will, [people’s] souls are cut off from truth.” He was talking about the people who frustrated and disappointed him, the people who supported bad policies, who did and said untrue things. They were not wrong on purpose! They thought they were correct…largely because someone had misinformed, even manipulated them. The same is true today.\n\n\n[*] The original title of \nMeditations\n \n(\nTa eis heauton\n) roughly translates as\n To Himself \nor \nThings to one’s self\n. That’s what Marcus was doing. He’s exploring his fears, his desires, his flaws, his virtues. He was trying to get to know “the backroads of the self,” as Marcus writes in Book 4.\n\n\n[*] Because he was writing \nto himself,\n writing about the things he struggled with and needed to work on, it’s easy to miss it, but Marcus seems to have a great sense of humor. There is a letter from Marcus to his tutor Fronto about a prank he played on a shepherd. There are also a couple of jokes in \nMeditations\n, including one about a guy who was “so rich that he had no place to shit.”\n\n\n[*] Again, Marcus wasn’t an unfeeling robot. He didn’t stuff things down. He was a husband and a father. He wrote beautifully, took principled stands, worked hard and sacrificed. He explains in Book 1 that he learned from his teacher Sextus, “not to display anger or other emotions. To be free of passion and yet full of \nlove\n.” Beautiful. \n\n\n[*] What’s so strange about this, about how often Stoicism is associated today with “has no emotions,” is that all the Stoics are explicit in how natural it is to have emotions, in deed and word. Like, how much more explicit do you need to get than the fact that of the maybe dozen or so surviving anecdotes about Marcus, \nTHREE have him crying\n! \n\n\n[*] I could not even begin to understand Marcus’s passage about losing children until I became a parent. Of Marcus’s children, five sons and three daughters died before he did. No parent should outlive their children. To lose eight of them? So young? It staggers the mind. “Unfair” does not even come close. It’s grotesque. What helped Marcus deal with loss after loss, \nBrand Blanshard points out\n, was that he held firmly that the universe was not only logical but good, so he saw it as his duty to not fight against the swings of Fortune. Yet it did stagger him, and multiple times he writes in \nMeditations\n about this loss, as it was unquestionably the hardest thing he ever went through.\n\n\n[*] We can imagine, as he buried \nhalf \nof his children, there were times Marcus wanted to lash out, give in to anger, rage at fate, the gods, and the world. Yet, \nMeditations\n \nis replete with timeless warnings against this. In Book 7, he quotes a lost line from a play by Euripides: “Why should we be angry at the world? As if the world would notice.” \n\n\n[*] Unlike most of the emperors, \nMarcus actually loved his wife\n. Despite (unproven) rumors of his wife Faustina’s adultery, Marcus loved her deeply for all their 35 years of marriage. He once wrote to his tutor Fronto, “I would rather live on Gyara [a desert island for criminals] with her than in this palace without her.’”\n\n\n[*] But as they say, \nyour calendar doesn’t lie.\n Marcus spent years away from Rome, fighting wars and visiting provinces, including time in Greece, as all students of philosophy considered a must. He had cases to adjudicate, dignitaries to receive, and things to write, undoubtedly spending much time reading, training, and serving the people of Rome. In many ways, he was like those of us who claim that family comes first, but then place many other things before them, whether essential or not. The irony is that Marcus never aspired to be emperor, and though he didn’t like the job, it consumed his life. Perhaps Faustina’s infidelity and the problems with Commodus were partly due to his absence—a cautionary tale for us all to not just talk about being a family man, but to truly be one.\n\n\n[*] Not a lot of people understand this…but you actually don’t have to have an opinion about everything. You don’t have to decide if something is good or bad. Marcus says limiting the amount of opinions we have is one of the most powerful things we can do in life. Do you need to have an opinion about the scandal of the moment—is it changing anything? Do you need to have an opinion about the way your kid does their hair? So what if this person likes music that sounds weird to you? So what if that person is a vegetarian? “These things are not asking to be judged by you,” ​Marcus writes​. “Leave them alone.”\n\n\n[*] Or what about when someone thinks something we disagree with or says something stupid? Marcus’ answer: “We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not let it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power to shape our judgments.” Be indifferent to what makes no difference, as Marcus says, so you can focus your attention on the things that actually do.\n\n\n[*] That’s not to say we should completely close ourselves off from those who think or say things we disagree with. In Book 6, Marcus writes, “If anyone can refute me—show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective—I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.”\n\n\n[*] It might be one of the hardest tasks in the world right now—to not let assholes turn you into an asshole. To not let cruelty harden you, to not let stupidity make you bitter, to not let outrage pull you down to its level. “The best revenge,” Marcus wrote in Book 6, “is to not be like that.”\n\n\n[*] Later, in Book 7, writes to himself: “Take care that you don’t treat inhumanity as it treats human beings.” What does that mean? What exactly does Marcus mean by “inhumanity”? Hurricanes are inhuman. ChatGPT is inhuman. A hurricane is inhuman. Torture is inhuman. With a passage like this, I’ve come to find it helpful to look at various translations.\n\n\nIn his great annotated edition of \nMeditations\n, Robin Waterfield translated that same passage like this: “Be sure not to behave toward antisocial people as people behave toward other people.”\n\n\nIn the Hicks & Hicks translation, \nThe Emperor’s Handbook\n, it’s, “Don’t feel for misanthropes what they feel for mankind.”\n\n\nThe 19th-century British translator George Long has it like this, “Take care not to feel towards the inhuman as they feel towards men.”\n\n\nAnd, finally, \nThe Daily Stoic\n translator Steve Hanselman has, “See to it that you don’t hold feelings toward misanthropes like they do for other people.”\n\n\nWhat Marcus is really saying is that you can’t let the world, you can’t let other people get you down or change you. In fact, a more colloquial and modern way to translate the essence of his quote might be: \n“Don’t let the sonsofbitches turn you into a sonuvabitch.”\n\n\n[*] On this idea of not letting inhumanity drive him away from humanity, \nRobert Greene once told me\n his favorite passage from \nMeditations\n \nis the one where Marcus uses the analogy of being in the ring with someone fighting dirty. “We don’t denounce them for it or get upset with them or regard them from then on as violent types,” Marcus writes. “We just keep an eye on them after that. Not out of hatred or suspicion. Just keeping a friendly distance. We need to do that in other areas. We need to excuse what our sparring partners do, and just keep our distance—without suspicion or hatred.”\n\n\n[*] No matter what happens—good times or bad, fair or unfair, order or chaos—Marcus wrote, our job always remains the same. “No matter what anyone says or does,” he writes in Book 7, “my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, ‘No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.’” \nWhat is your most important job?\n he emphasizes. “To be a good person.”\n\n\n[*] A corollary to that…how many of us focus on getting better at our most important job? How many of us actually work on being good? “A better wrestler?” Marcus asks himself, rhetorically, referring to the time he spent improving at one of his hobbies. “But not a better citizen, a better person, a better resource in tight places, a better forgiver of faults?” (\nHere’s my piece\n about the habits that will make you better at your most important job—being a good person).\n\n\n[*] And when you do your job, you don’t need “the third thing,” Marcus writes. “When you’ve done well and another has benefited by it, why like a fool do you look for a third thing on top—credit for the good deed or a favor in return?” You don’t need recognition, gratitude, appreciation, or acknowledgement for doing your job, which is to do good, to be good, to help people, to be kind. \n\n\n[*] There’s a wonderful moment in Book 6 where Marcus Aurelius asks, what is it that we should prize as humans? “An audience clapping?” he writes. “No. No more than the clacking of their tongues. Which is all that public praise amounts to—a clacking of tongues.” In one of those interviews I referred to earlier, Jerry Seinfeld highlighted this quote. “How funny is it for me as a comedian to read that?” he said. \n\n\n[*] When Marcus says an audience clapping is no more than a clacking of tongues, Seinfeld went on, he means, “Do not pursue other people’s recognition as an end goal in itself. What you pursue is the quality of the work that you’re doing, not the result of people liking it or hating it. The hell with that. Likes. What are likes? Other people liked it. If you’re pursuing that, your train is off the track!”\n\n\n[*] In short: Focus on effort, not outcomes. It’s insane to tie your wellbeing to things outside of your control, Marcus says in Book 6. If you did your best, if you gave it your all, if you acted with your best judgment—that’s what matters…regardless of whether it’s a good or bad outcome.\n\n\n[*] You want to talk about what’s \nreally\n insane? Worrying about other people’s opinions of you when you’re dead! As Marcus Aurelius writes in Book 4, “People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that people who remember them will soon die too. And those after them in turn.” And suppose all those people you want to remember you were immortal, Marcus says, “What good would it do you?” \nYou’ll still be dead!\n\n\n[*] As for worrying about other people’s opinions of you while you’re alive? In Book 12, as \nMeditations\n is wrapping up, Marcus writes “It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.”\n\n\n[*] Sometimes when I speak to military groups, I like to share one of my favorite lines from \nMeditations\n: “Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?” I love how Marcus delivers that line—with a shrug. So what? There’s no shame in needing help. Whether it’s therapy, asking for advice, or hiring someone to support you, it’s not a weakness to seek help—it’s a strength. We’re all comrades on this mission, Marcus reminded himself. Don’t let pride hold you back from getting the support you need to succeed.\n\n\n[*] This was a breakthrough I had during the pandemic. Suddenly, I had a lot less to worry about. I wasn’t doing the things that, in the past, I told myself were the causes of my anxiety. I wasn’t having to get to this plane. I wasn’t battling traffic to get somewhere on time. I wasn’t preparing for this talk or that one. So you’d think that my anxiety would have gone way down. But it didn’t. And what I realized is that anxiety has nothing to do with any of these things, as Marcus talks about in Book 9. “Today I escaped from anxiety,” he says. “Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions—not outside.” He writes this during a plague, no less.\n\n\n[*] Related… \nI had an incredible conversation with Dr. Becky Kennedy\n that every parent—or really just any human—needs to listen to​. (If you haven’t read her book,\n \n​Good Inside\n​\n, yet…what are you doing?!). \nIn the episode\n, she defined anxiety as “some amount of uncertainty coupled with our underestimation of our ability to cope.” It reminded me of what Marcus writes in Book 5: “Consider all that you’ve gone through, all that you’ve survived.”\n\n\n[*] One more on the topic of anxiety. “Don’t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole,” Marcus reminded himself in Book 8. “Stick with the situation at hand.” Focus on the moment. Waste no time thinking about the monsters that may or may not be up ahead.\n\n\n[*] Working on \nthe 10th anniversary edition\n of \nThe Obstacle Is the Way\n, I spent a lot of time with the now famous passage that inspired the book. But do you know what he was talking about specifically? He was talking about difficult people! “Our actions may be impeded by them,” goes the full passage, “but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”\n\n\n[*] In Book 1, Marcus talks about one of the difficult people in his own life, who made him a better person. He thanks “the gods” for blessing him with a troublesome stepbrother, “one,” he writes, “whose character challenged me to improve my own.” And Marcus didn’t just tolerate his stepbrother Lucius Verus, he found a way to work with him, even naming him co-emperor!\n\n\n[*] During \n​my conversation with Francis Ford Coppola​\n, he shared that he had just recently lost his wife of 60 years. In coping with her loss, he came across a Marcus quote that lifted his spirits. If you lose a loved one, it said, honor them. “My wife was very good,” he explained. “If someone was alone or sick or something, she’d call them up and be comforting to them. And I’m not like that, you know? So I started to do that. People that I know, some guys my age who have no grandchildren, I call them up and say, Hey, how are you? And they are so pleased and so kind. And that’s how I keep my wife in my life.”\n\n\n[*] After many years of using a slide deck when I give talks, for my \n2024 speaking tour\n, I decided to try doing it without slides. Because it seemed harder and different. Because it seemed a little bit scary to stand in front of a few thousand people and \nnot\n do what I’d done for so long, what I was used to, what I was comfortable with. In Book 12​, Marcus writes about holding the reins in his non-dominant hand as both an exercise to practice and a metaphor for doing the difficult thing. He wanted to get good at doing things both ways, at developing the ability to thrive in any and all situations.\n\n\n[*] \nMeditations\n \nitself is a wonderful example of Marcus’ commitment to holding the reins in his non-dominant hand. He wrote \nMeditations\n \nin Greek, his non-native tongue! Marcus spoke Latin, but Greek was “the language of philosophy,” Hays tells us in the introduction of his translation. There he is, in his private journal, challenging himself to write in a more difficult language and doing so so beautifully that he endures all these centuries later.\n\n\n[*] At the end of 2022, as part of The Daily Stoic New Year New You Challenge, my wife and I picked a word we were going to use as our lodestar for the year. We picked ‘Less,’ inspired by what Marcus writes in Book 4, “If you seek tranquillity, do less.” And then he follows the note to himself with some clarification. Not nothing, less. Do only what’s essential. “Which brings a double satisfaction,” he writes, “to do less, better.”\n\n\n[*] One thing that makes it hard to do less is to think the opposite of work is laziness or lounging around. It’s not, it’s leisure. In the ancient world, leisure meant scholé. School. But not the get good grades and get ahead kind of school. No, in the ancient world, it meant learning and studying and pursuing higher things to enrich one’s soul and spirit. Marcus said it was a requirement to “Give yourself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around.”\n\n\n[*] He had 14 children, a nagging stomach ailment, and was taking philosophy classes—during a pandemic. Oh, and he was emperor of Rome, responsible for 120 million people across 2.2 million square miles. He was the busiest man in the world, so how did he manage it all without falling behind or losing his mind? We know that one question played a huge role. “Most of what we say and do is not essential,” Marcus writes in Book 4. “If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquility. Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’”\n\n\n[*] Another great, clarifying question Marcus liked to ask himself, “Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do \nthis\n anymore?” I actually think this is one of the funniest and the most cutting lines in \nMeditations\n. You think you deserve a long life, but look at how you spend it? You think your life is so great but you complain about all the stuff you hate doing?!\n\n\n[*] I like the way Marcus talked about the cleansing effects of a walk in nature. On his evening walks, he liked to take a moment to look up at the stars to “wash off the mud of life below.”\n\n\n[*] In the mud of life below, in the muck and mire of daily life, it’s easy to get frustrated with people. It’s easy to prioritize the wrong things, to lose perspective. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment or forget the actual magnitude of your problems. Which is why Marcus reminded himself to zoom out. At least twice in \nMeditations\n, he speaks of taking “Plato’s view” and by that he means getting up high and looking down on humanity. “To see them from above,” he writes, “the thousands of animal herds, the rituals, the voyages on calm or stormy seas, the different ways we come into the world, share it with one another and leave it.”\n\n\n[*] In another passage, in Book 9, Marcus offers another way to get some perspective in order to declutter his mind:\n\n\nYou can discard most of the junk that clutters your mind—things that exist only there—and clear out space for yourself: \n\n\n… by comprehending the scale of the world \n\n\n… by contemplating infinite time \n\n\n… by thinking of the speed with which things change—each part of every thing; the narrow space between our birth and death; the infinite time before; the equally unbounded time that follows.\n\n\n[*] I’ve written about\n the importance of having a leadership philosophy\n, of establishing your principles and rules. Marcus called them “epithets for the self,” which he lays out in Book 10. Upright. Modest. Straightforward. Sane. Cooperative. Disinterested. Those were his non-negotiables. “If you maintain your claim to these epithets,” he wrote, “without caring if others apply them to you or not—you’ll become a new person, living a new life.” \n\n\n[*] People are just doing their job. I don’t just mean at work. After bumping into a particularly frustrating person, Marcus asks himself in Book 9, “Is a world without shamelessness possible?” No, he answers. “There have to be shameless people in the world. This is one of them.” This is just someone fulfilling their role. \n\n\n[*] People who are selfish. People who are obnoxious. People who are ignorant, egotistical, people who recline their seats on airplanes, and frustrate you to no end. When you come across these people, Marcus writes in Book 8, “You can hold your breath until you’re blue in the face, and they’ll just go on doing it.”\n\n\n[*] Shortly after we purchased the rights to publish the leather-bound \nMeditations\n from Daily Stoic, Putin invaded Ukraine. We were working with a Texas-based company that had long printed Bibles in Belarus. I consulted experts, including two members of Congress. The message was clear: doing business with Belarus was, in effect, doing business with Russia. ​​That wasn’t what I wanted to hear—and alternatives weren’t obvious. I liked the Belarusian team. Bids from the U.K. were up to 200% higher. Then it struck me that the very book I was printing included a relevant line: “Just that you do the right thing,” Marcus writes in Book 6. “The rest doesn’t matter.” I decided I didn’t want any part of contributing to a country aligned with Russia. I couldn’t change the world, but I could change this. Yes, it would cost more and take longer. And no one would have noticed if I hadn’t, but I would have.\n\n\n[*] In some cases, sure, it’s hard to know what it means to do the right thing. But here is a pretty simple test we can apply most of the time—try not to do anything that, as Marcus Aurelius said, “requires walls or curtains.” If we’re inclined to hide it, we probably shouldn’t do it. If we dread the publicity, maybe we’re not living or doing right. \n\n\n[*] Marcus noticed how often he found himself praying to get something. Wouldn’t it be better, he thought, to make yourself strong enough not to need whatever you were hoping the gods would grace you with? Epictetus calls this blowing your own nose. Don’t wait around hoping for someone to save you. Instead, listen to Marcus’ empowering call to, “get active in your own rescue—if you care for yourself at all—and do it while you can.”\n\n\n[*] “Good fortune,” Marcus writes in Book 5, “is what you make for yourself.” But he didn’t mean that as some business people and gurus claim—that we make our own luck and destiny. He was referring to “good character, good intentions and good actions.”\n\n\n[*] When Marcus talked about his own luck and good fortune, it wasn’t that he was chosen out of 50 million Romans to be emperor. It wasn’t that he was born strong and tall. It wasn’t that he was born a free man instead of a slave. It wasn’t any of the other things he could have counted as blessings. Instead, it was this: “That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself—of having to take something from someone else.” What a wonderful and kind way to look at life.\n\n\n[*] And sometimes, he had to make some sacrifices to help to come up with the resources to help those in need. When the Antonine plague wiped out much of the Roman army, the people couldn’t afford to pay taxes for new troops. “So Marcus held a vast auction of contents of the imperial palace, Brand Blanshard writes in \nFour Reasonable Men\n, “and sold gold, crystal and myrrhine drinking vessels, even royal vases, his wife’s silk and gold-embroidered clothing, even certain jewels in fact, which he had discovered in some quantity in an inner sanctum of Hadrian’s.”\n\n\n[*] Dio Cassius describes the scene of Marcus returning to Rome after being gone, on the battlefields, for a long time. As he addressed the people, he made a reference to how long he’d been forced to be away. “Eight!” the people cried lovingly. “Eight!” as they held up four fingers on each hand. He had been gone for eight years. The weight of this hit him at that moment, and so too must have the adoration of the crowd, even though Marcus often told himself how worthless this was. As a token of his gratitude and beneficence, he would distribute to them eight hundred sesterces apiece, the largest gift from the emperor to the people ever given.\n\n\n[*] It’s always revealing to look closely at those who, in contrast to Marcus, seem to prize and protect their financial success above all else. The writer Anne Lamott jokes in Bird by Bird, “Ever wonder what God thinks of money? Just look at the people he gives it to.” Marcus Aurelius writes in \nMeditations\n, “Robbers, perverts, killers, and tyrants—gather for your inspection their so-called pleasures!”\n\n\n[*] In \nthe first 100 lessons piece\n, I talked about the line from Book 9, “Don’t go expecting the perfection of Plato’s Republic.” But I left off what he says to do instead: “Be satisfied with even the smallest progress.” \nYou’re never going to be perfect—there is no such thing\n. You’re human. So instead, aim for progress, even the smallest amount.\n\n\n[*] Two years into writing \nDiscipline is Destiny, \nI hit a wall. One morning, I was going through my research, boxes that contained thousands of note cards. As a whole, they overwhelmed me—what they contained, how they might fit together into a book. It seemed impossible to comprehend. I grabbed one. Just two dozen words in red Sharpie. When had I written it? Why? What prompted it? All I know is what it said: “Trust the process. Keep doing my cards. When I check them in June—if I have done my work—there will be a book there.” It saved me. Not from the work, of course, but from myself. From giving up. From abandoning the system and process that has served me so well. In one of the best passages in \nMeditations\n, Marcus, almost certainly in the depths of some personal crisis of faith, reminds himself to “Love the discipline you know, and let it support you.”\n\n\n[*] Along the lines of not going around expecting Plato’s Republic, Marcus reminds us that we must not argue with reality. We have to see “Not what your enemy sees and hopes that you will,” he wrote, “but what’s really there.” We have to strip things of “the legend that encrusts them,” remove the magical thinking that distorts our picture of the world.\n\n\n[*] “Let us accept it,” Marcus Aurelius wrote to himself in his journal, “as we accept what the doctor prescribes. It may not always be pleasant, but we embrace it—because we want to get well.” He could have been talking about the pandemic of his times, the stresses of his job or the children he had buried. He could have been talking of his own ill health, the bad weather, or the noise of the city’s streets. We don’t know, we just know that whatever it was, he was trying to find a way to be grateful for it. “Convince yourself that everything is the gift of the gods,” Marcus said, “that things are good and always will be.”\n\n\n[*] Speaking of gifts, Marcus writes in Book 8, “give yourself a gift: the present moment.” Remind yourself, he says, that the past and the future are not in our power, only the present is. The less energy we waste regretting the past or worrying about the future, the more energy we will have for what’s in front of us.\n\n\n[*] I\n’ve written about some of the craziness and obstacles we ran into opening a small-town bookstore\n. I often found myself thinking about a passage in Book 4, where Marcus is lamenting all that had happened to him. \nIt’s unfortunate\n that this happened. Then he catches himself and decides, “No. It’s fortunate that this has happened \nto me\n.” Because this is what he trained for. Because this is a challenge he could rise to.\n\n\n[*] For all the darkness that Marcus Aurelius observed and lamented, he also knew there was an inexhaustible supply of goodness out there. Actually, he knew it wasn’t out there at all—it was within himself. “Dig deep,” he writes, “the water—goodness is down there. And as long as you keep digging, it will keep bubbling up.”\n\n\n[*] I said before that I read a few biographies, essays, and articles of Marcus. In Ernest Renan’s 1882 biography of Marcus, he writes the true majesty of Marcus was that his exactingness was directed only at himself. He found a way to work with flawed people, putting them to service for the good of the empire, searching them for virtues that he celebrated, accepting their vices, which he knew were not in his control. “Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself,” Marcus reminded himself in Book 5.\n\n\n[*] Marcus said when things happen that we would have preferred didn’t happen, there are basically two kinds of people: people who see an obstacle and people who see an opportunity. He loved the metaphor of fire—he wanted to be like the “blazing fire [that] takes whatever you throw on it and consumes it, and rises higher” because of it.\n\n\n[*] I’ve lived for years on a quiet, unpaved country road—lined with trees, crossed more often by deer than people, and increasingly, littered with trash. At first, the dumping—tires, bottles, dead animals—just made me furious and hopeless. But one morning, walking with my kids, a line from Book 9 hit me: “And you can also commit injustice by doing nothing.” \nHow many times can I walk past this mess before I become complicit in it? \nI thought. \nSo I started cleaning it up\n.\n \n\n\n[*] In the struggle against injustice, it’s easy to let bitterness and hatred harden your heart. As Marcus wrote in Book 8: “What doesn’t transmit light creates its own darkness.” In my favorite novel, \nThe Moviegoer\n \nby Walker Percy (who loved Stoicism and wrote about it often), the wisest character in the book Aunt Emily says there’s “one thing I believe and I believe it with every fibre of my being. A man must live by his lights and do what little he can and do it as best he can. In this world goodness is destined to be defeated. But a man must go down fighting. That is victory. To do anything less is to be less than a man.” That captures Stoicism to me.\n\n\n[*] From the mentor who most shaped his life, his adopted step-father Antoninus, Marcus said he admired the way Antoninus worked hard but also made sure “to take adequate care of himself…With the result that he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or ointment.” Marcus said that life is short and if we practice bad habits, if we don’t take care of ourselves, if we aren’t willing to change, we will surely shorten that time.\n\n\n[*] Another important lesson Marcus learned from Antoninus? “This in particular,” Marcus said, “his willingness to yield the floor to experts—in oratory, law, psychology, whatever—and to support them energetically, so that each of them could fulfill his potential.” We live in a time where anti-intellectualism is a real problem. Not reading is often seen as a badge of honor. Leaders surrounded by yes men and sycophants. An administration suppressing ideas it doesn’t like or thinks dangerous. It’s a dangerous and destructive trend, one we must reject in favor of taking Marcus as our model. He filled his court with brilliant public servants. Though he did not particularly like him, he hired his childhood tutor Fronto because he was unquestionably the greatest rhetorician of the time. Though Junius Rusticus was famously hard on his pupil (Marcus relates he was “often upset with Rusticus”), Marcus immediately elevated him to major roles within his court. Marcus later wrote that of all the good fortune the gods gave him, having Rusticus in his life was the greatest. And, though his ego could be frustrating at times, Marcus hired Galen, the most famous physician and polymath of antiquity because he wanted to raise “the intellectual tone” of his court.\n\n\n[*] It was Epictetus who said that \nevery situation has two handles\n—one that will bear weight and one that won’t. We get to choose how we look at things. We get to look for the best handle to grab. As Marcus would put it in Book 5, we get to choose the thoughts we dye the world with.\n\n\n[*] There’s that great Japanese proverb: fall down seven times, get up eight. Think of how life knocked this guy down. Wars. Palace intrigue. Floods and famines. A Pandemic. As I said, he lost \neight \nof his children. He lost his co-emperor, most of the Praetorian Guard, his top commander, his most trusted colleague Furius Victorinus—all to the plague. The Roman historian Cassius Dio mused that Marcus “did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved…and was involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign.” But he got up every time fate knocked him down. “When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances,” he wrote, “revert at once to yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep on going back to it.”\n\n\n[*] He also reminded himself and all of us not to “feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren’t packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human—however imperfectly—and fully embrace the pursuit that you’ve embarked on.” Failure is inevitable. Mistakes are bound to happen.\n\n\n[*] Throughout the Antonine Plague, Marcus liked to remind himself that the future is the past repeated. “Look at the past,” he says in \nMeditations\n, “and from that, extrapolate the future: the same thing. No escape from the rhythm of events.”\n\n\n[*] Courage. Justice. Temperance. Wisdom. They are the most essential virtues in Stoicism, what Marcus called the “touchstones of goodness.” “If, at some point in your life,” Marcus Aurelius wrote, “you should come across anything better than justice, truth, self-control, courage — it must be an extraordinary thing indeed.”\n\n\n[*] D.H. Lawrence once wrote sneeringly that Benjamin Franklin’s view of virtue was that of a horse in a paddock, fenced in on all sides. That’s precisely what Marcus loved about those four virtues. Instead of chafing at these constraints, he saw them for what they were: Boundaries. Protections. They were protections against himself, ​protections against being “caesarified”​ and ​“stained purple” by his corrupting position​. They kept him ​good in a job​ and a world that had created so many bad people.\n\n\n[*] “What injures the hive injures the bee,” Marcus writes in Book 6. When other people suffer, we suffer. When the world suffers, we suffer. When we take actions, we have to always think: What would happen if everyone did this? What are the costs of my decisions for other people?\n\n\n[*] Earlier in Book 6, Marcus gives himself (and us) a command to keep an important idea in mind. “Meditate often,” he writes, “on the interconnectedness and mutual interdependence of all things in the universe. All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other.” He is talking about the Stoic concept of \nSympatheia\n, the idea that, as Seneca wrote, “All that you behold, that which comprises both god and man, is one—we are the parts of one great body.”\n\n\n[*] \nStillness Is The Key\n to that which we all seek.\n \n“People try to get away from it all,” Marcus said, “to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. Nowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions—than your own soul.” \n\n\n[*] I’m a firm believer that how long we live is outside of our control. I don’t feel comfortable trading the present for an uncertain future. “You could be good today,” the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote. “But instead you choose tomorrow.” That quote haunts me as much as it inspires me. And it does a lot of each.\n\n\n[*] Do the verb instead of trying to be the noun. “You must build up your life action by action,” Marcus said. Virtue is something you \ndo\n not something you \nare.\n\n\n[*] It can be easy to lose sight of this. Because we know how competitive the world is. Because things aren’t exactly going our way. Because we want to reach our full potential. But ultimately, we only need to care about our character. The rest is fated from it.  “Life is short,” Marcus Aurelius said, and “the fruit of this life is a good character.” It’s true in reverse too: A good life is the fruit of good character. \n\n\n[*] “The whole concept of writing the \nMeditations\n,” said Donald Robertson, Marcus’ greatest biographer, when I talked to him on the Daily Stoic Podcast, “is about following through on this thing he remembers his mother saying when he was younger—which is to work on his character, to improve his mind and not just his external behavior.”\n\n\n[*] In the year 175, Marcus Aurelius was betrayed by his general Avidius Cassius in an attempted coup. As always, Marcus responded with poise, even as he and his family were in mortal danger. “The nearer a man is to a calm mind,” he wrote of such moments of crisis, “the closer he is to strength.” A real man doesn’t give way to rage or panic, he reminded himself, willing himself to be like Antoninus. “Such a person has strength, courage and endurance,” he would say, “unlike the angry and complaining.”\n\n\n[*] So if we throw out all these motivations for our ambitions, what’s left to prize in ourselves? “I think it’s this: to do (and not do) what we were designed for,” Marcus writes. “That’s the goal of all trades, all arts, and what each of them aims at: that the thing they create should do what it was designed to do.”\n\n\n[*] In one of my favorite passages of \nMeditations\n, Marcus marvels at “nature’s inadvertence.” A baker, he writes, makes the dough, kneads it, and then puts it in the oven. Then physics, then Nature takes over. “The way loaves of bread split open on top in the oven,” Marcus writes; “the ridges are just by-products of the baking, and yet pleasing, somehow: they rouse our appetite without our knowing why.” It’s a beautiful observation about such a banal part of daily life, something only a poet could see. In a sense, we ought to see \nMeditations\n as the most wonderful example of this same process, a bit of nature’s inadvertence. Marcus’ philosophy dictated that he sit down, think, keep the ideas in mind, read and reread about them, talk with others about them, and write about them. Not for us. Not for publication. Not to impress anyone or make money. And yet, what emerged from that—the accidental byproduct—is one of the greatest works ever written.\n\n\n[*] The great Admiral James Stockdale, who spent seven years under heinous conditions enduring near-constant torture in a Vietnamese prison camp, liked to quote Epictetus: “A podium and a prison is each a place, one high and the other low, but in either place your freedom of choice can be maintained if you so wish.” Marcus put it this way in Book 5, “Anywhere a man can live, there he can also live well. \nBut he must live in a palace\n—well then, he can also live well in a palace.” And he proved it, just as he lived well in a military camp, thanks to, he said, “your ability to control your thoughts.”\n\n\n[*] Along those lines, Marcus writes, “Everything turns on your assumptions about it, and that’s on you. You can pluck out the hasty judgment at will, and like steering a ship around the point, you will find calm seas, fair weather and a safe port.”\n\n\n[*] In one of the \nmost haunting paintings\n you’ll ever see—an 11×8-foot oil painting by Eugene Delacroix (a student of the Stoics)—a dying Marcus Aurelius, weakened by life’s hardships, addresses his weeping friends gathered at his bedside. Marcus knew the sun was setting on his life, as he would say to his bodyguard. With his last breaths, he is said to have drawn the attention of his friends, shown weeping and gathered around him in Delacroix’s painting. “Why do you weep for me?” Marcus asked them. Instead, he said, think about the plague still ravaging Rome. Think about how to keep it from claiming more lives. And think about “death,” he said, “the common lot of us all” and getting your own affairs in order before the sun sets on your life too.\n\n\n***\n\n\nLike all of us, there was a part of Marcus Aurelius that wanted to be good and a part that inclined towards something worse.\n\n\nHe had ideals, he had a temper. He had ambitions—some of which were selfless and some of which were selfish. He made commitments—as a father, a spouse, a leader—and then he also had urges and drives as a human being. There was a part of him that was lazy and a part of him that was hardworking. He was a good person and then he was given absolute power…which we know has the incredible power to corrupt.\n\n\nIn Book 6, he captures the struggle perfectly. “Fight to be the person philosophy tried to make you,” he writes. \n\n\nLately, I’ve taken to signing books with my own spin on it and I have the same thing written on a notecard on my desk: “Fight to be the person philosophy wants you to be.”\n\n\nThat’s the lesson I’ll leave you with: this is a lifelong fight we are in. Marcus even talks about it towards the end of \nMeditations\n. He asks himself, \nHow old are you? How much longer are you going to keep falling short? When are you going to get this together?\n It was the battle of his life. Up until the day he died, he was struggling with this. But he always kept fighting.\n\n\nAnd that’s what we have to do. That’s why I keep reading and rereading \nMeditations\n. That’s why I’ve taken to signing it in books. \n\n\nFight for those four virtues, those “touchstones of goodness.” \n\n\nFight for that part of you that wants to be good, courageous, disciplined, and wise. \n\n\nFight to be the person philosophy wants you to be. \n\n\n\n\nIn \nMeditations\n, Marcus Aurelius shares roughly 500 rules of life—profound insights and guidelines for living well.\n\n\nAnd if you’re ready to explore Meditations more deeply, \nour official How To Read Meditations guide will show you the way\n.

    "content": "Table of Contents\nIntroduction\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius\nConclusion\nWorks Cited\nIntroduction\nPeople react to conflicts and crisis in disparate means with some being too radical whilst others stand out as opportunists. The ability to react to and solve predicaments in the right way is a fundamental element of determining a good ruler who is leading his or her subjects in an admirable way. Knowing the different techniques of addressing the challenges facing the human race is essential for human survival and one must strive to have such information.\nThe following are some of the issues that Marcus Aurelius attempted to address as he wrote \nMeditations\n, which is a set of his personal view on how he presumed life should be lived. How do the classics help when one or a country is witnessing predicaments, and does the intelligence of the poets, philosophers as well as rulers relevant in such times? In 1915, Robert Graves utilized the knowledge he got from poets to fight in an ongoing war.\nIn 1991, Anthony Swofford, a US marine official, successfully used the principles of Homer and Camus during the Gulf War. However, most readers including Frederick the Great assert that one of the best sources of instruction and moderation is Marcus Aurelius’s \nMeditations\n. This assertion is evident in the way Marcus has displayed his loosely structured set of opinions linked with stoic philosophy.\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius\nBorn on April 26, A.D. 121, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was an emperor of Rome that ruled the Roman Empire for two decades. He was a nephew as well as the son-in law of Antonius Pius and came from a noble family, which was very religious, which is an indication why his ruling was virtuous.\nMarcus lost his parents at a young age and he was later adopted by his grandfather, Annius Verus. Throughout his childhood, he was coached to dress plainly and restrain from luxurious lifestyle. Moreover, he participated in activities such as wrestling and hunting that nurtured his body to become robust. His hardiness was evident in the way he was fascinated with meeting vicious boars.\nMarcus inherited the throne after the demise of Antoninus Pius in 161 and allied with L. Ceoinius Commodus, a man who had been adopted by Pius at a young age. They worked together in administrating the empire. However, soon after Marcus had assumed the throne, a stream of war plagued Rome (Van Ackeren 112).\nThe aftermath of the war was an epidemic that was accompanied with starvation, which was caused by floods that had damaged huge quantities of crops. Marcus applied every means possible including selling the regal ornaments to collect money that could combat the crisis. Eventually, the Roman Empire under his leadership eliminated barbarian communities, and reestablished the stability of Rome. Being the commander-in-chief, he was a shrewd as he appointed effective lieutenants (Sellars 84).\nMarcus was not only faced with war predicaments, but also domestic problems. His wife, Faustina, bore him children that he loved dearly. All his children died except Commodus who was viewed as puny, as well as insignificant by the subjects. After the demise of Marcus, he assumed the leadership of the Empire despite the immense resentment. The subjects complained that his leadership was oppressive and brutal. It is essential to have such knowledge even as one understands the contents of Marcus’ book- \nMeditations\n (Fein 36-37).\nIn \nMeditations\n, Marcus spent a little time and space in addressing the issue of war. However, it is evident that he spent a lot of time in his two decades of governance in prevalent battles. There are passages in his book that prove this assertion and suggest that he was familiar with the battleground.\nIn the book, he asks if one has ever witnessed a hand, foot, or a head cut from the other parts of the body and lying miles away. He asserts that that is what people do to themselves when they attempt to ignore what goes on in their lives or when they do something that is considered narcissistic (Sellars 88).\nIt is certain that, as a fighter, Marcus had the ability to administrate prudently as well as meticulously. He strived to imitate the previous rulers, but always made sure that he abstained from corruption and performed all his duties accountably and responsibly. However, it would amount to bias for one to conclude that he was a perfect leader as he was erroneous in particular scenarios. For instance, he introduced a compeer in Rome similar to that in Verus, an extremely risky innovation for people feared that it would cause obliteration.\nSome years later, the fears came into reality when Diocletian caused the Roman Empire to disintegrate because of the innovation. He also gaffed in his governance because it was too centralized despite being impartial. He established charitable foundations to cater for his deprived citizens and regions that were vulnerable to calamities. However, one notable fact was his reluctant approach towards Christians (Talbot 63-66).\nDuring his administration, several incidents of devotion resulted to death of many believers. It is also unwise to argue that the atrocities on Christian martyrs occurred without his knowledge, and if that is true, then he failed in administering his duties as an emperor.\nHowever, irrespective of these errors, Marcus is still undoubtedly among the best rulers of the Roman Empire and is admired by many. Though he ruled during hard times for the Roman Empire, he was meek, shrewd, and humble. “Meditations” stands out as evidence that he had little interest with issues such as personal fame, but rather he was a knowledgeable man with a considerate soul (Sellars 46).\n“Meditations” is a collection of short stories that have been composed in twelve disparate books. The writings appear in a way that some are in short paragraphs whilst others carry only single lines. Marcus begins his writing by sharing the knowledge he got from his relatives, tutors, as well as allies.\nHe mentions his grandfather, the good relationship he had with him, and the virtues he taught him. The book is difficult to visualize as a material that can be used by conflicting forces. Some of the contents support the hand-to-hand warfare that most lieutenants discourage.\nHe states that weapons should be laid down and encourages soldiers to clench their fists and fight. Although Marcus is not precise in his writing, he shares a notable advice on pain-management by stating that no one experiences anything that s/he cannot tolerate. He also advises non-combatants who are disheartened by carnages that the solution to such problems is to count on their blessings (Fein 36-37).\nThe doctrine of stoicism is also prevalent in the book, a philosophy that he was deeply fascinated in and applied in his solving daily challenges in life. The Roman Empire had two competing schools that employed two disparate doctrines, viz. Stoicism and Epicureanism.\nStoicism asserts that virtue alone can cause contentment as well as peace of mind. Virtue in this case consists of obedience to the top authority and everything that it provides, in mastery that surpasses the human race’s animal nature, in liberation from every perturbation, as well as in the whole autonomy of the Inner Self.\nAs a resolute follower of the philosophy, Marcus strived to live according to the virtue that the creed suggested. He writes \nMeditations\n to share all the knowledge he learned throughout his lifetime, thus making the book a good source that people can reflect on when making various decisions about life (Van Ackeren 119).\nMarcus states that as a human being, there is imperfection, intermittent missteps, and faults; however, these elements do not prevent one from pursuing the upright path. Most of his views that he offers in the book are extensive and rational.\nMost of his passages attempt to address the triviality of man (Fein 36-37). “Meditations” is a succession of devout exercises and the extent to which the book can relieve a reader relies on the individual’s belief in human progress. Marcus categorically states that people normally have similar behaviors and problems from generation to generation, for example, marrying, falling ill, as well as fighting.\nAccording to Marcus, nothing novel is introduced in any of these generations and man can do nothing to alter this fact. Marcus states that life is not good and compares it to a rotting meat. However, he argues that if an individual can accept every challenge then one can easily become happy.\nAnother persistent theme in the book is the issue of mortality – everything that is alive will soon experience death. Marcus states that death is a natural practice just as sex. Irrespective of the position one holds here on earth, everyone will soon become history. Marcus asks why people lament the demise of a loved one whilst life is so insignificant and somnolent (Vernezze 91).\nHe therefore encourages his readers to face death with joy because it relieves those who depart from numerous depressions of the world. He states that whatever is of great significance is ones spirit and not the body. Marcus also uses \nMeditations\n to advise his readers to ensure that everything they do let it appear as if it were the last thing they were to participate in before they died.\nHe argues that people commit injustice by being idle. In everything an individual does, his or her main intention should always be to improve (Van Ackeren120). Moreover, one should refrain from arrogance and avoid getting irritated with individuals who are imprudent and of little importance. He advises people to strive in achieving modesty, piousness, honesty, and cooperate with others in accomplishing various activities in the society (Vernezze 75).\nFor those who might find it hard it to get out of their beds, they should note that what completes them as human beings is working in unity with other people. Furthermore, he reminds those who are prone to fleeing when their fellow neighbors hurt them to acknowledge that one can always flee any minute he or she desires as long as he or she is to the back roads of him/herself.\nAccording to Marcus, everything that exists on the surface of the earth plays a particular role. Man’s role as a creature that thinks is to free his memory from debris and delusions. He asserts that the applause of peers and posterity are all delusions that one must refrain from in the journey of life.\nHe argues that doing things for commemoration is as insignificant as seeking popularity, and thus every individual must be ready to live with their minuscule abilities (Fein 36-37). The main intent of Marcus book is to teach his readers how to endure challenges. Even though the theme of endurance if prevalent in the book, Marcus also advises his readers on how they can enjoy life.\nHe states despite the delights of the flesh are meager sensation; sometimes people should part with their books and participate in leisure activities such as “pretty singing”. It is vividly evident that most of the ideas that Marcus shares in \nMeditations\n are a direct reflection of the life he lived before and during his reign as a Roman Emperor (Talbot 63-66).\nConclusion\nClearly, “Meditations” is a book that almost every individual can use as a manual for solving the challenges that appear in life. However, some of Marcus’ thoughts are eccentric hence revealing the weak side of the book. For instance, he argues that evil causes more danger on the perpetrator than on the victim.\nThis assertion is not true in cases such as assassination, rape, or slavery. Furthermore, the assertion that evils committed because of lust are more dangerous than those committed due to anger is erroneous. It is better for a man to commit infidelity with a neighbor’s wife than murdering her. Some of the passages also sound as a New Year’s resolution whilst others call for readers to leap their thoughts; for instance, when he states, “don’t gussy your imagination”- very few readers can comprehend the message.\nSome who have read the book admit that it is an impregnable wintry kingdom because it informs one of the worst and once an individual has such information, he or she will rarely get surprised on such issues. Nonetheless, for those who need some advice in life, it is time they became acquainted with \nMeditations\n by Marcus Aurelius.\nWorks Cited\nFein, Michael. “Meditations.” \nLibrary Journal\n 135.15 (2010): 36-37.

Marcus Aurelius as a Man of Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\nO the ancient world Marcus Aurelius was best known not as a wise ruler and conqueror of German and Sarmatian barbarians but as philosopher and patron of learning. His Latin biographer\n opens with the words: 'Marcus Antoninus, who was a lifelong philosopher, excelling all chiefs of the state in holiness'; so in the tenth century, in Suidas' \nLexicon\n,\n he is 'Marcus Antoninus, King of the Romans, the entirely laudable philosopher.' In his lifetime the advocates of Christian liberty so address him. Thus Justin Martyr in his first \nApology\n terms him Verissimus, the philosopher; and Athenagoras, an Athenian philosopher, begins with the address: 'To the Emperors M. Aurelius Antoninus and L. Aurelius Commodus, conquerors of Armenia and Sarmatia, but more than all else philosophers.'\n\n\nThough professing philosophy as his guide in life and following her rule, Marcus makes no pretence to learning or wisdom for himself. Indeed, in the account of his education in his own first Book, he dwells on the variety and excellence of the teaching he had enjoyed, theoretical and practical alike, but expresses satisfaction more than once\n that the admonition of his confidential teacher \n​\nRusticus, a sense of his own inability, and the urgent claims of his imperial station had diverted him from his boyish ambitions as student and author to the endeavour to act justly and to speak the truth, not to converse and write about goodness. \n\nAgain, on the very threshold of his second Book, he interrupts himself to say: 'Put away your books, remember that you are an old man, do not suffer your real self to be any longer a bond-servant.'\n That by his books he means not his library merely but actual composition is evident from a later passage: 'Do not wander from your path any longer; you are not likely to read your Notebooks, your Deeds of ancient worthies of Rome and Greece, the Extracts you made from literature and put by against old age.'\n\n\nClearly he had, at some time, devoted himself to a variety of composition, some of it original, some derived from his reading and reflection in history and literature. Here he resembles his successor Julian, our own King Alfred, and Frederick the Great of Prussia. His aspirations had been postponed to his public duty, his writing put on one side and never completed. \n\nThat we possess a considerable and, in form at least, most original work from his pen contradicts this depreciation of literary ambition and his repeatedly expressed diffidence of his own gift for philosophy. \n\nBesides the present work, written in Greek, there survive the fragments of a correspondence with his Latin and rhetoric master, the famous orator, M. Cornelius Fronto.\n The letters cover the years \na.d.\n 138–\ncirc\n. 165. This \n​\ncollection of familiar letters and original compositions was recovered by Cardinal Angelo Mai from the palimpsest pages of a Christian manuscript, in the Ambrosian and Vatican libraries, in the early nineteenth century. \n\nSadly fragmentary and partly ruined by chemical reagents, it consists partly of notes exchanged by Fronto and his royal pupils, Marcus and Lucius, and their adoptive father, the Emperor Pius; partly of more studied compositions in epistolary form by the correspondents, models of the new or revived Latin style, the \nelocutio novella\n, which Hadrian himself encouraged and practised. Mainly written in this archaizing Latin, the collection includes a few Greek epistles as well as a speech in which Fronto attempts an erotic discourse in imitation of those in Plato's \nPhaedrus\n. This and another Greek essay were designed in compliment to Domitia Lucilla, the mother of Marcus, herself a patroness of Greek letters, in whose father's house Herodes Atticus had stayed in his youth. Fronto encloses it under cover to Marcus, begging him to remove any blunders in the unfamiliar tongue before submitting it to Domitia.\n\n\nThis correspondence, evidently in part written for publication, proves that Marcus had, at this period, literary aims which went beyond the official oratory which Fronto had been engaged to teach him. We read of hexameter verses\n by Marcus, the subject of playful secrecy between him and his tutor, and Fronto devotes two long letters to the outlines of Latin eloquence and historical composition. Marcus once writes: 'I prefer now to write in Greek. You ask me why! Because I want to experiment, to see whether what I have not been taught will be more obedient than what I have, for indeed what I have \n​\nendeavoured to learn plays truant.'\n Marcus had been used from his boyhood to speak and write in Greek; it was as familiar to him, no doubt, as French was to Frederick the Great. \n\nThere followed in Marcus' life a momentous breach with mere rhetoric. He had been reading Aristo, the Stoic philosopher. He tells Fronto that he cannot argue on both sides of a question any longer; he is indeed turning from his old tutor to follow Rusticus and philosophy. Fronto rallies him upon the contorted and crabbed stock-in-trade of his new Stoic models, warns him shrewdly of the danger he runs in deserting Latin eloquence, but to no purpose. The young Caesar had made up his mind; for him oratory becomes henceforth a dead letter.\n\n\nHere and there, in the subsequent centuries, we meet references to a collection of private letters by Marcus, in Greek, which survived, whether genuine or not, to the ninth or the tenth century, the period of the Byzantine renaissance. Thus Philostratus remarks of this correspondence, in distinction from imperial constitutions and rescripts, that: 'besides precision of thought, the strength of Marcus' character is stamped on his words',\n a summary of the Emperor's style not inapt to parts of his authentic Book. Again in the ninth century, the learned Patriarch Photius,\n writing to Amphilochius, Bishop of Cyzicus, commends to his attention certain epistolary models, \n​\nPlato's letters, the epistles ascribed to Phalaris, and those of the 'royal philosopher'. Since many of these ancient collections consist of brief apophthegms, addressed to fictitious recipients, and are indeed in no sense genuine private letters, it is possible that the \nLetters of Marcus\n were issued by an enterprising bookseller and consisted, among other matter, of pieces from the genuine work of the 'royal philosopher'. This might help to explain the curiously diverse forms in which Marcus is quoted by Suidas. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. The History of the Book in the Early Centuries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the publication of the \nMeditations\n we know as little as we do of that of most ancient and some modern masterpieces. There have been advocates of the view that Marcus gave his thoughts to the public before his death in \na.d.\n 180. Their intimate and unpremeditated character, and a certain disorder in them as they have survived, seem decisive against such a theory. Who the editor was, when they did come out, is equally unknown. Chryseros, a freedman of Marcus, author of a chronicle to the date of Commodus, has been suggested, but by pure hypothesis. We can but surmise that the work was done, under the direction of a relative or friend, by a subordinate, perhaps by Marcus' Greek secretary, Alexander.\n The present state of the work suggests that the author's notes were already in some order, though left unfinished, and that they were treated scrupulously.\n\n\nRemarkably little evidence has survived from the troubled period which followed upon the accession of Commodus in \na.d.\n 180 and from the still darker years of anarchy which followed. There are, however, a few \n​\ndoubtful indications that a philosophic treatise by Marcus Aurelius was known to the world, something a little more definite than the loose phrases of his biographer, writing so many years later, indicate. \n\nThus Herodian, a writer of the third century, who opens his history\n with the accession of Commodus, notices the old-fashioned mannerism of Marcus,\n and in the epitome of the history of Dio Cassius, who wrote under the Severi, we meet an occasional phrase in the speeches put into Marcus' mouth, which attempts to give verisimilitude by the use of words which recall the Emperor's writings. For example, in a speech read to the troops, a kind of Order of the Day, on the occasion of the ill-timed revolt of Avidius Cassius, Marcus is made to say: 'how has faith perished, how have expectations of honour perished'.\n This seems an echo of 'Faith and Reverence and Justice and Truth have gone to Olympus from the wide-paved earth'.\n The oration ends: 'if only I might make this gain out of the present evils, if I might but \nsettle the matter happily\n and show to all the world that a right use may be made even of civil wars.'\n Here the proverbial saying, 'to settle the matter happily', is an echo from the \nMeditations\n. There are other touches of this kind, but the ground is difficult and doubtful, and opinions will vary about the value of such evidence. \n\nIn Julian, who was Emperor \na.d.\n 361–63, I can find no certain verbal reminiscence of Marcus' work, such as you \n​\nwould expect from so ardent an admirer.\n Even in that curious vision of judgement, the \nSymposium\n or \nKronia\n, where Marcus is made to speak in his own behalf, the language, though faithful to his habitual manner of life and thought, does not reflect the style we know so well. There is no attempt at verbal representation. The nearest suggestion is in the passage where Marcus is summoned before the divine conclave. He enters shining in bodily form with the 'purest and clearest light'.\n This looks like a reference to two passages in the \nMeditations\n. Julian's own style is rhetorical to excess and atticizing, he is full of reminiscences of Homer and the Attic tragedians and Plato, his linguistic affinity is to the Neoplatonist writers and not to Stoicism; thus he may have instinctively avoided any verbal imitation of Marcus. Indeed his own work belongs to an epoch which had absorbed the practical truths of Stoicism and Christianity, but which had submerged the distinctive reflective attitude of the Porch under a flood of orientalism and mystical writing.\n\n\nThe first direct mention of the \nMeditations\n as a \nbook\n known to his hearers is made by the friend of Julian, the orator Themistius, in \na.d.\n 364, the year after Julian's death. He is addressing Valens, the feeble colleague of Valentinian I, on \nBrotherly Love\n, and says: 'You have no need of the \nAdmonitions\n of a Marcus or the excellent words of this or that ruler of days gone by; you have your Phoenix in your own house.'\n The title \nAdmonitions\n \n​\nrecalls a word used by the biographer of Avidius Cassius,\n whose work belongs to about this date. He says: 'Antoninus, on the eve of his departure for the Marcomannic war, was invited not from flattery but seriously to publish his philosophic precepts. Accordingly, for three successive days, the emperor disputed publicly in a series of \nExhortations\n.' If it is true that this biography and others in the \nHistoria Augusta\n were composed under the influence of Julian, to justify his political ideals, we see that the writer states here the view which contemporaries had adopted of the \nMeditations\n, viz. that they were admonitions intended for the world. Many years later the fiction has altered, and they are thought to be \nOffices\n written for the behoof of Commodus, as Cicero wrote his famous \nOffices\n for his son Marcus. Still later we find them described in a manuscript of extracts from the \nMeditations\n as the \nSecond Manual of Epictetus\n! After Themistius, darkness falls again. There is no extract, such as we might well have expected, in the ample store of prose and poetry in the \nEclogues\n of Johannes Stobaeus \ncirca\n \na.d.\n 450. We have to wait more than four centuries for the next notice of the book. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. The Meditations from the Ninth to the Fifteenth Century\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArethas, the deacon of Patras who was afterwards Archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, a follower of Photius and fellow worker in the revival of Greek literature at the end of the ninth century (\ncirca\n \na.d.\n 850–935), was a great collector of manuscripts. Writing at some date before 907, when he was a bishop, to Demetrius, \n​\nArchbishop of Heracleia, he sends him an ancient volume of the \nMeditations\n: 'I have had for some time an old copy of the Emperor Marcus' most profitable book, so old indeed that it is altogether falling to pieces. \n. . .\n This I have had copied and am able to hand down to posterity in its new dress. \n. . .\n Thinking accordingly that it would be a sign of a grudging disposition to retain what is a duplicate, I designed to make your Holiness the inheritor of my former possession.'\n So he sends the Archbishop the old copy and puts the new one on his shelves. Arethas writes with the enthusiasm of a lover of learning and wise doctrine, as well as with the ardour of a bibliophile. He does not say, however, that Marcus' book is a rarity, only that its teaching is most profitable and that he has obtained an old and tattered copy. He writes as of a volume with which his correspondent will be already acquainted. \n\nWe know what the restored and perhaps emended text would have been like from the many beautiful manuscripts from Arethas' collection in our libraries, the \nEuclid\n, for instance, in the Bodleian, the \nPlato\n, which Clarke brought to Oxford from Patmos, the \nClement of Alexandria\n in Paris, and the Aristotle's \nCategories\n at Rome.\n But alas! the inestimable \nMeditations\n has vanished, and we can only surmise that the learned deacon edited this copy with the same care that he lavished upon his Plato. Many scholars suppose that this Arethas volume is the ancestor of our present late versions. All that is certain is what we can \n​\ngather from the letter to Demetrius, and from notes made by the learned Archbishop of Caesarea in others of his books,\n where he refers to passages in Marcus' \nTreatise to Himself\n, the title which the book bore in the manuscript from which the first edition was printed by Gesner in \na.d.\n 1558–9. \n\nSome fifty years later (\ncirca\n \na.d.\n 950) Suidas published his \nLexicon\n. There he refers to the Emperor's \nConduct of his own Life\n, in xii Books,\n the first mention of the now familiar division into twelve Books. The \nLexicon\n has preserved many passages of our author and, as Suidas clearly used earlier collections, we have important evidence as to the text from an older tradition than that of our manuscripts, if these, as some scholars suppose, are all to be traced to Arethas' recension. \n\nTwo hundred years later Tzetzes (\na.d.\n 1110–85) cites Marcus by name in his \nChiliades\n,\n but as that work is in verse, what he quotes cannot be used to correct the actual words of our text. \n\nThat the reputation of the philosophic Emperor persisted in the Byzantine period, and perhaps some knowledge of his sayings, is shown by four notes in the Bodleian manuscript of Arrian's \nDiscourses of Epictetus\n.\n The \n​\nmanuscript is of the late eleventh or early twelfth century and these scholia may, so Schenkl thought, be copied from an earlier manuscript. On the words of Epictetus: 'the individual part, which God has torn from himself and given to us', the marginal note says: 'presumably what flows from above'. Schenkl derives this from Arethas himself, linking it with a marginal note in Dio Chrysostom,\n where Arethas quotes from Marcus: 'all flows from that other world' or, as he cites it, 'from above'. \n\nWhere Epictetus writes: 'So watch yourselves in what you do and you will discover of what calling (or \"sect\") you are', there is a note: 'It is proper to say the same also of us, that few are of the sect of Antoninus.' Again in the chapter on the Cynic's life and profession, where Epictetus says: 'perhaps we do not perceive his greatness, do not worthily imagine Diogenes' character', the note is: 'nor we the character of Antoninus.' So, on the text: 'What is the character of his doctrines? On these we accept or reject him', the annotator has: 'carry this out in regard to monks who appear to be somewhat: if these have the character of those who formerly ruled in this sect, Antoninus and his followers, I mean, let them be Fathers.'\n The passages show that there was still an interest in the Stoic school and a recognition that Marcus Antoninus professed its tenets.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n​\n\n\nIV. The Knowledge of the Book at the Opening of the Italian Renaissance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat the \nMeditations\n were in the hands of the learned in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is attested by the number of manuscripts of excerpts which have survived from that period. The extracts in the Munich MS. Graec. 323 (Mo 81) are indeed thought to be as late as the early sixteenth century, and the New College MS. Coll: Nov: 270, of the C class (C\nv\n), which was written for Richard Pace, since 1519 Dean of St. Paul's, London, by Zacharias Callierges, is dated 8 December 1523, in Rome. Some scholars\n are of opinion that the excerpts of the X group, which in most examples are mixed with extracts from Aelian's \nDe Animalibus\n, are derived from an anthology made by Maximus Planudes (\na.d.\n 1260–1310). In his \nEcclesiastical History\n Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos, \na.d.\n 1295–1360, states\n that 'Marcus Antoninus composed a book for the education of his son Marcus, full of all worldly experience and instruction', meaning by Marcus the Emperor Commodus, who in his inscriptions often usurped his father's name. \n\nThis false description of the \nMeditations\n has induced some writers to imagine a lost work of this character by Marcus, for which there is no evidence. It may have had another result—it perhaps suggested to Antonio Guevara his extravagant romance, commonly known as the \nGolden Book of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius\n.\n This may well be \n​\ndescribed as 'full of worldly wisdom'. It was a favourite book of Montaigne's father,\n though he himself disliked the euphuistic style of Guevara, as well probably as his absurd matter. The \nGolden Book\n and the \nDiall\n had so great a vogue in the sixteenth century (being more often translated than any book except the \nHoly Scriptures\n) that they created in the reading public an entirely erroneous judgement of Marcus' character and especially of his relations with Faustina. Only gradually, in the seventeenth century, as the \nMeditations\n became known, and the public taste altered, was this romantic judgement corrected. A curious problem is suggested by Guevara's two books. When he says that he had translated a Greek original in Florence, had he some hazy knowledge of the existence in the Laurentian library of a manuscript of extracts from the \nMeditations\n? It is impossible to know, but apparently he was ignorant of Greek, on his own confession, and vehement protests were made, in his lifetime, against his romancing.\n\n\nIt looks as if even the learned were, at this date, unfamiliar with the \nMeditations\n themselves, although they were aware of the existence of the book and some few possessed copies of extracts from the work. This comparative oblivion is also shown by five references to  the actual book in the middle of the sixteenth century, just before the issue of the \neditio princeps\n. In his \nBibliotheca\n\n\n​\nUniversalis\n, \na.d.\n 1545, Conrad Gesner refers to the \nMeditations\n as the work of the author of the \nItinerarium\n, and employs the title \nκαθ᾽ ἑαυτόν\n.\n The same title is used by Lilius Giraldus,\n in the same year, and he speaks of Marcus' various learning almost as if he fancied that the extracts from Aelian's \nNatural History\n, which are interspersed with Marcus' own words in these manuscripts, were Marcus' own work, just as elsewhere he reports a work by the Emperor \nOn Fishes\n.\n Neither Petrarch\n nor any of the writers of this period cited by Gataker in his \nTestimonia\n shows an acquaintance with what Marcus actually wrote. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV. The Editio Princeps, a.d. 1559\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent history of the \nMeditations\n dates from the issue of the first printed edition by Andreas Gesner, filius, at Zürich in \na.d.\n 1558–9. It was accompanied by Marinus' \nProclus vel De Felicitate\n, also a first edition. Both books were translated into Latin, the former by Wm. Xylander of Augsburg (1532–76), and brief notes to each author were added. \n\nThe importance of this text of the \nMeditations\n is that the manuscript from which Conrad Gesner caused it to be printed is now lost, so that it is one of the two principal sources of all modern texts, there being only one complete manuscript, Vaticanus Gk. 1950 (referred to as A), with which to compare it. The other evidence for the text, besides these two, is of little independent value. The book \n​\nwas produced under the auspices of the learned naturalist and humanist, Conrad Gesner (\na.d.\n 1516–65), who says in his dedicatory letter\n that he 'received the books of Marcus from the gifted poet Michael Toxites\n from the library of Otto Heinrich, Prince Palatine', that is from the famous collection at Heidelberg. Conrad Gesner, writing in 1562, states that he 'gave the books of M. Antoninus and Marinus to his cousin Andrew to print in 1558, with Latin translations, of Antoninus by William Xylander, of Marinus by a friend, a learned youth, who modestly desired to be anonymous'.\n\n\nXylander dates his Latin dedication from Heidelberg in October 1558, whither he had recently gone from Basel to become professor of Greek and later librarian to the Prince Palatine. It looks as though the printers took the volume to pieces and sent the Marcus leaves to Xylander, for the latter says in the dedicatory introduction to his second edition (Basel, Guarinus 1568): 'the copy of Antoninus which I used was, so Gesner stated, taken from a volume belonging to the famous library of the late illustrious Elector Palatine, Otto Heinrich.'\n He implies, that \n​\nis, that the pages he worked with bore no evidence of their origin. \n\nXylander, as he states in his notes, made a few corrections of the manuscript text, and these were most, not quite all, adopted by Gesner in the printed text. Generally the text was left as he found it, his Latin translation indicating what he took to be the sense, and silently suggesting a good many emendations. This is the same scrupulous regard for the manuscript text which he observed in his edition of Plutarch (\nVitae\n 1560, \nMoralia\n 1570). He explains his method in the introduction to this second edition: 'in case some ungenerous critic should fancy that I am serving him with a rechauffe, I have corrected my preface, the author's words in the Greek and Latin, and not only have I removed the misprints, I have also reviewed and corrected my own translation in several places and made some additions to the notes. \n. . .\n Some places\n there are in the book which it appeared better not to touch rather than by conjecture to substitute possibly for Antoninus' own words diction that would be foreign to him.' \n\nThe translation is most elegant, and, on the whole, remarkably exact. Sometimes Xylander goes astray, and sometimes his fidelity to the words makes little sense, although it has the advantage of showing what text he had before him. Still we cannot use his work, like one of the old verbal Latin translations, as certain evidence of the words of his manuscript. He sometimes paraphrases and condenses, but we can detect words and sentences which the printers overlooked. He says in his first dedication: 'I neither desired nor indeed was I justified in attempting a faithful verbal translation. I have indeed followed the \n \n​\nsense, but whether I have hit it always I leave to the judgement of others. There are many plain reasons why this was difficult, yet I confess that in some points I required the help either of divination or of a bold departure whether from the Greek manuscript or from normal Greek usage.'\n We are reminded of Wyttenbach's tribute to the great scholar's memory: 'Xylander I love for his candour, his probity, his honesty, manifest proofs of which are conspicuous not only in his writings but in his whole life.'\n We must remember that he was printing a plain text, without \nmarginalia\n or footnotes, and be grateful to him for his fidelity. \n\nSo much of the editor. What is to be said of Gesner's compositors? Xylander writes in the second edition: 'as my lucubration \n. . .\n was vilely reproduced by the carelessness of the printers and so published that it might fairly be held not to have been edited at all, I have been thinking for some time of remedying this'.\n The indictment is serious and the original editor's words have been repeated by subsequent editors. I am inclined to think it exaggerated. We must at least remember that Xylander made his corrections for the second edition without reference to the manuscript. That, it appears, had not been returned to Heidelberg; certainly Xylander makes no reference to it (except the above) in his second edition. Is it not possible that in reading the printed text he noticed and  \n​\ncorrected many puerile mistakes which reproduced the original faithfully? Of the Gesner press very little has been written, so that its reputation is not known.\n\n\nA curious problem, of little importance for the criticism of our text, has lately been suggested by H. Schenkl. He argues that the manuscript of the \nMeditations\n, in distinction from that of Marinus' \nProclus\n, did not come from the Palatine library, but was procured by Toxites from a source unknown, perhaps even copied by himself from the original, thus introducing a further stage in the manuscript tradition. Yet the Latin title-page to the \nMeditations\n bears the words: \ne bibliotheca illustrissimi principis Ottonis Henrici\n; and, as if to make assurance doubly sure, there are on the reverse to the Latin title of the \nProclus\n the words 'The Printer to the Reader. Forasmuch as Marinus' \nLife of Proclus\n was contained in the same codex with the books of M. Antoninus, I thought I too ought to include it, especially as this work of Marinus is not a big one and has not, so far as I know, been previously published; in its argument too it is not far removed from the books of Antoninus.'\n This agrees with what both Conrad Gesner and Xylander believed. Again Xylander in his second dedication gives as one reason for including the \nMeditations\n that it originally came from a library other treasures from which he is now printing for the first time with the permission of Prince Otto Heinrich's successor.\n\n\nNothing would appear more certain than that the two books were in a single volume, brought to Gesner at Zürich by Toxites from Heidelberg. Schenkl, however, \n​\npoints out that Xylander, writing in 1568, says only that he was assured by Conrad Gesner that the \nMarcus\n came from the Palatine library, not that he knew that fact himself.\n He suggests therefore that Gesner, in his dedication, confused the \nMarinus\n which did come from the Palatine library with the \nMarcus\n, which did not. He appears to overlook the fact that the printer says expressly that both books were in the same volume, a volume which Xylander presumably never saw in its entirety. Schenkl has a further point. He says: 'Inasmuch as the copy of Marinus' \nProclus\n handed to Gesner by Toxites was certainly copied from a codex formerly in the Palatine library \nand now preserved in the Vatican at Rome\n, it might easily happen that Gesner should fancy that what he found noted about the origin of his apograph applied also to the \nMeditations\n, which he supposed were bound up in the same volume.'\n It is strange that, if this were indeed the fact, Boissonade should have treated the first edition of Marinus' \nProclus\n as evidence for the text instead of consulting the manuscript from which it is here presumed to be derived. Further, the Vatican MS. to which Schenkl is referring is dated.\n It was written by Andreas Darmarius in Madrid for Julius Pacius de Beriga in \na.d.\n 1579,\n just twenty years after Gesner printed the \nMarcus\n and the \nMarinus\n. Again, the first edition stops with the opening words of ch. 22, the printer adding: 'pauca videntur deesse', whereas Pacius' \n​\nmanuscript, now in the Palatine library at Rome, contains the entire thirty-eight chapters. \n\nThe lamentable truth is that both parts of Gesner's MS. are at present lost. The precious codex may never have been reassembled and returned to Heidelberg, or it may have been lost in the journey to Rome or in the later passage of some of the Vatican treasures to Paris and back. It is no longer accessible to our inquiry. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVI. Description of the Editio Princeps and the Manuscript Sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first edition is a small 8\nvo\n volume, clearly printed on good paper and in an elegant Greek fount. It has none of the magnificence of some early classics and, like the small Elzevirs, is clearly intended for the pocket. A good copy, like Bywater's in the Bodleian Library, measures 6.5 in. by 3.9 in. The pagination is as follows: \n\n\n\nLatin title, verso blank: \nM.

Then the Greek text, pp. 157—81, which ends at \nἐκ δὲ τῆς τοιαύτης\n viz. ch. 22, with a note: Pauca uidentur deesse. Page 182 blank, 1 blank leaf. \n\nThe existent manuscript sources are the following: \n\nA. Vaticanus Graecus 1950, contained in a codex\n which passed to the Vatican Library from Stefano Gradi's\n collection in \na.d.\n 1683. The codex contains the following manuscripts now bound up together, written by at least five different hands. The authors so combined are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXenophon, \nCyropaedia\n and other works,\n fols. 1–271v (272–9 blank).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXenophon, \nMemorabilia Socratis\n, fols. 280–340v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Antoninus (except viii. 61), fols. 341–392v. (incl. 389 and 389 a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpictetus, \nManual\n (Christian paraphrase), fols. 392v-399.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFragmenta rhetorica; Epicurus, \nAllocutio\n, \n fols. 401–4v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n​\n\n\nMaximus Tyrius, \nPhilosophumena\n,\n fols. 408–518v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcinous, \nDogmata Platonis\n, fols. 519–41.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAristotle: \nDe Motu Animalium\n,\n fols. 542–5v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFols. 271–404v (except 337a) are in the third hand, dated late fourteenth or early fifteenth century. \n\nSubsidiary evidence is derived from the many collections of excerpts from Marcus Antoninus, dating from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, contained in the following: \n\nD.

The actual proportion of lines in D to the lines in the modern text (between i and ix. 31) is 2:5 (roughly 1,026 out of 2,621 lines). \n\nIn fol. 354, among the excerpts from Marcus, occur two fragments (24 and 33) of Epicuri \nAllocutio\n, which is contained in Vat.

Cod. Monacensis 529 (olim Augustanus). This XIVth cent, manuscript includes most of the X excerpts, with vii. 23, which precedes (22, 18, 7) and is followed by vi. 35, 43, 44; iv. 33; vi. 33, interpolated between (31 and 39); (vii. 63) precedes vii. 64; viii. 21 (part) precedes (viii. 34). The manuscript ends with xi. 16, 17, 18. 1, \nἀλλήγων\n. \n\nThis is the Codex Hoeschelianus which M. Casaubon used. He says that Hoeschel consulted for his collation \ntwo\n manuscripts at Augsburg, one ending at \nτί γίνεται\n ix. 40, the other at \nτῶν κρειττόνων (ἔνεκεν)\n xi. 18. 1. \n\nThe X fragments are normally intermingled with excerpts from Aelian \nπερὶ ζῴων\n. The order is given in tabular form by E. Miller, \nMélanges de litt. grecque\n, Paris, 1868, p. 347, and in their editions by Stich, Leipsic, 1882, p. xiii, and Schenkl 1913, p. xxxv. There is no obvious connexion between the contents of the passages from the two authors, nor has any explanation been discovered for the strange disorder of the extracts from Marcus. \n\nIt will be noticed that the C extracts come from the earlier Books, the X from the later. Only vii. 63, 70 and 71, and viii. 54 are common to D and X. \n\nThe excerpts in Mo 2 and X together equal about one-ninth of the whole \nMeditations\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVII. Value of the Manuscripts and of the Editio Princeps for the text\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evidence to be derived from the existing manuscripts for the construction of the text of the \nMeditations\n is scanty enough in quantity, as will be seen from the last section. In quality it is also unsatisfactory, since all the \n​\nmanuscripts, as well as the lost original of the first edition, P cod., belong indisputably to a single tradition. This is now represented by evidence which is not older than the late fourteenth century; and there is some reason to believe that the archetype to which all our manuscripts point is a copy of the eleventh or twelfth century, which had already suffered by verbal corruption and by the loss of sentences which, unless new evidence be discovered, are indeterminable in meaning and extent. \n\nThe two complete, or nearly complete, sources are Vat. Graec. 1950, A, and Gesner's printed text, P, which depends upon a lost manuscript, P cod. The order of their chapters and, in general, their text correspond with our present printed text. In spite of minor discrepancies they agree remarkably in the places where they are corrupt or deficient, in many minor errors, and even in small points of orthography and accentuation. \n\nThe manuscripts of Excerpts follow closely the text of either A or P, or both A and P, but scholars are agreed that none of them is directly derived from A or P. Even D, which so closely resembles A, is not a transcript from A, but appears to be derived from a source which lies between (A and D) and the presumed archetype of A (D) and P. This follows not only from the fact that D often gives a condensed version of A, or a loose paraphrase of its presumed original, and not only from its agreement at places with P as against A (for these may all be conjectural corrections by its scribe), but from the fact that it has preserved a number of scholia, of which A retains no trace. The Excerpts C and X present a text which at one place in C certainly, at more than one place in X, appears to be derived from what we have called the archetype. This is and P. This follows not only from the fact that D often gives a condensed version of A, or a loose paraphrase of its presumed original, and not only from its agreement at places with P as against A (for these may all be conjectural corrections by its scribe), but from the fact that it has preserved a number of scholia, of which A retains no trace. The Excerpts C and X present a text which at one place in C certainly, at more than one place in X, appears to especially clear in Book V ch. 8, 5, where X preserves six words which are certainly genuine, although their omission from P had not been noticed because they are not essential to the argument. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n​\nAlthough the Excerpts are of little importance, if any, for the actual words of the text, since their occasional improvements of passages may well be due to ingenious emendation, they raise a general problem as to the integrity of the present disposition of the several chapters. The X Excerpts especially are not arranged in the order of the complete manuscripts; they begin, for example, with extracts from Book vii, but in the order ch. 22, ch. 18, ch. 7. The fact that our present text appears dislocated at more than one place, that the sequence of thought of the writer is often interrupted by what appears to be an intrusive aphorism, or series of aphorisms, suggests when coupled with this evidence that the order of the various sections has been at some time disturbed. This is discussed elsewhere (\ninfra\n, pp. lxvii-lxxiv). \n\nThere is another remarkable feature in these Excerpts. The actual chapters excerpted differ in the various groups. Even D, which does follow our present order, has a collection of chapters which only at two places overlaps the other Excerpts. Thus, if we had only the Excerpts to go on, we could put together a considerable series of the actual \nMeditations\n, with practically no repetitions. It appears, therefore, possible that there was at an earlier date a single collection, a \nFlorilegium\n of Marcus' thoughts, from which these have been derived. It will be noticed that, with very few exceptions, the extracts thus preserved would be of a general moral character; all the aphorisms which are of a personal nature would have disappeared. \n\nTo return to P and A. The resemblances between them point to a common original. But in externals they are remarkably different. P is arranged in twelve Books: A has no numerical marks of Books, although some of the Books are separated by an interval. The chapters in the several Books in P are distinguished, although they are not numbered, and the distinctions correspond generally with the \n​\nsequence of thought; the chapters in A are marked by rubricated capitals, but the resultant divisions are frequently incoherent. Yet it is in the actual text that the difference is most remarkable. If we read P, we meet many small errors, such as are common in all manuscripts, but the general impression left is of a text with many idiosyncrasies but an intelligible text; if, on the other hand, we take up A at any point, not only do we find continual omissions of lines, parts of lines, even of longer passages of some two or three lines, but the amount of corruption of individual words is such that it is possible to make only an approach to the meaning of the author, sometimes not even that. Besides this, especially in the later Books, we meet forms of words which are corrupted according to no known rules of manuscript interpretation. The problem of the origin of all these difficulties is intensified by the fact that the hand of the scribe is quite a good one, although late, that he has often patched up a \nlapsus calami\n, and has occasionally written a correction of a form in the space above the line, without erasing his first attempt. He appears to have tried to be intelligent. \n\nClearly the principal problem of an editor is to determine what weight is to be attached to the evidence of P and A respectively in a case of difference between them, and what are the grounds for his decision. In regard to P there is one question to be answered first, viz. how widely does the printed text of Gesner, which Xylander edited, differ from the lost original P cod.? There are many obvious misprints in P, which Xylander remedied in the second or Basel edition; there are many other mistakes in the form of words, which Xylander did not correct, some of which certainly appear to be misprints, though others may have been errors of the scribe. Schenkl's estimate is that Xylander corrected thirty-six mistakes but overlooked forty-four, generally graver, errors, which he had silently amended in his original Latin version. It is certain that \n​\nXylander did not carry out his revision as carefully as we should expect and wish; but he was now working on the printed text and no longer had the manuscript to consult. Thus there is an at least plausible explanation of his apparent negligence, viz. that he was anxious to preserve, so far as possible, the text of the original manuscript. Certainly he did this in the first edition, leaving his version or his notes to show the reader the mistakes he detected. Moreover, this was his practice in his great edition of Plutarch. It may be argued then, I think, that it would be just the graver mistakes of his original that he would leave intact. My own conclusion is that most of these blunders were in the original manuscript, that at least it is safer to work on this hypothesis. There is no evidence that either Toxites, who brought the manuscript to Conrad Gesner's attention, Conrad himself, or Andrew the printer corrected the text as it passed through their hands. We may, as the earlier editors did, use the evidence of P, with the necessary reservations. \n\nAs to the weight to be attached to A, the history of the twentieth century text exhibits first the effort of successive editors, by scholarly conjecture, to make an intelligible text on the basis of Xylander's two editions and the Lyons text of 1626. Secondly, the vulgate, thus derived from Xylander's text, was emended by the use of the manuscripts (first of the Excerpts, later of A as well as of the Excerpts), and the tendency to prefer A to P grew more marked from the date of Coraes's text of 18 16 and Schultz's of 1820. This movement culminated in Schenkl's text of 1913. The editor speaks of the Vatican manuscript 'coming into its own'; and his own practice is evident from the fact that, apart from such minutiae as final nu and sigma before a closed syllable, the Leipsic text differs in some 180 places from Leopold's Oxford text of 1908. Yet Leopold himself had said that A, in spite of its many patent errors, 'has often preserved the genuine reading \n​\nmore faithfully than P or made at least a closer approach to the truth'. Most of Schenkl's differences from Leopold arise from a restoration of A's readings or of something supposed to be indicated by them, and there are many places besides (in his \napp. crit.\n and \nadnotationis suppl.\n) where he has shown great ingenuity in the attempt to find a possible lost reading which might plausibly explain A's idiosyncrasies. \n\nThe hypothesis underlying this restoration is that A, by its fidelity to its original, a fidelity not shared by P cod., has preserved an older and truer version of their common original: the illiterate witness is more likely to give an unvarnished statement of what he saw than one who is more educated. This hypothesis has, no doubt, been adopted the more readily because in the criticism of many texts (for instance, of Aristotle's \nNicomachean Ethics\n and \nPoetics\n) early manuscripts have, in spite of, or even because of, their unsophisticated crudity, been given greater weight than later and more ostensibly literate manuscripts of the same text. In the case of A, however, as evidence for what Marcus wrote, we are not dealing with an old but with a very late manuscript, we are presuming that A has preserved more closely than P cod. the text of their common archetype, not that an early manuscript is \nceteris paribus\n likely to be nearer the original than a later one. Moreover, a close study of A's individual readings shows that many are deliberate, even if infelicitous, corrections of a text which P cod. has preserved, while a similar study of P shows traces of that very \nnaïveté\n of report which has been ascribed to A. Again, the existence of D shows that A and D depend upon an original which is one step further from the archetype of A D and P cod. than P cod. is. Further, a noticeable feature of A is its steady deterioration in accuracy in the later Books. M. Trannoy gives the statistics: Book i, errors common to P A, 17 to 20, errors peculiar to P, 14, \n​\npeculiar to A, 21; Book xii, common errors 17 to 20, individual to P, 21, to A, 80. Are we to suppose that A is a better witness in Book xii than in Book i, since this increase of error shows, by hypothesis, a greater simplicity and therefore a nearer correspondence with the truth? Finally, if A is to be considered analogous to certain manuscripts (K\nb\n, A\nc\n) of Aristotle, we ought to be able to point to some remarkable restorations of an old text which are derived from A's mistakes. But, so far as the modern editions go, there is not a single case of such restoration which is not based upon an error common to P and A. \n\nA different explanation is clearly possible, viz. that A is the work of an inexact scribe reporting (perhaps at secondhand) an earlier state of the text, whereas P's report of the same earlier text is generally more correct. In short, that P is the more credible of the two witnesses. There is nothing here to prevent a critic from preferring on intrinsic grounds a reading he finds in A to one in P; only, if the readings are equally possible intrinsically, the balance of probability is on the side of P. A study of the text, even in Schenkl, shows that, in fact, the present revised vulgate is far closer to the \neditio princeps\n than it is to A. P is not only more complete, but is in details far more accurate than A. \n\nAs to the archetype of A, Polak,\n who made a close study of this manuscript, concluded that it was probably copied from an eleventh- or twelfth-century manuscript, in which the words of the original \nscriptura continua\n were already separated, the breathings and accents supplied, and the sentences distinguished. If this view be adopted, then P cod. also must have been derived from a minuscule of that date; behind this our manuscripts do not point. Polak gives some instances of misreading, as he supposes, of an uncial text, but nearly all, if not all, of these can, I think, be explained on the hypothesis of a minuscule \n​\noriginal. If there are any mistakes of an uncial origin, and this is not certain, they would, we must suppose, have already been in the presumed archetype of P and A. \n\nSchenkl did not live to publish his proposed study of the text, but he appears to have thought that A, or perhaps its archetype of the eleventh or twelfth century, bears evidence of an editor of the text, who wrestled long and painfully with an old and mutilated original. He means, no doubt, Arethas. He goes further and suggests that the common source of all our manuscripts is the presumed edition of the learned deacon of Patras at the end of the ninth century. This is a suggestive and interesting hypothesis which other critics have adopted, but the evidence is too slight and conjectural to carry conviction. \n\nThere is, however, one source from which we can judge of this theory, the evidence of Suidas' \nLexicon\n. He has preserved, very fortunately, passages of considerable length from the \nMeditations\n. Wherever the extracts he gives are actual extracts, their text is substantially our present text, and what he gives must represent citations from his original sources, which are older than the tenth century, how old we cannot determine. Thus whatever Arethas did to the text, the evidence we have from Suidas suggests that the manuscript he used was in its readings close to the tradition preserved to us. Unfortunately the majority of the passages in Suidas are paraphrases of the original text, and cannot therefore be used as evidence for the exact words of the original; indeed it looks as though the source of many of them was not the text of the complete original, but a \nFlorilegium\n of some kind from the \nMeditations\n: they are so often introduced by \nὄτι\n or a similar word, like the passages we have in the C excerpts. If this be true, the process of making selections from Marcus had \n​\nalready begun before the time of Suidas, as would indeed be probable on general grounds. \n\nThere is one other line of inquiry to be considered in reference to the transmission of the \nMeditations\n. This depends on the length of the known omissions in A. The commonest length is of sentences consisting of from 30 to 40 letters, say an average of 35 letters. Schenkl has compared this modulus with the length of lines in the papyrus of Hierocles and with that in some old codices. I presume that he means especially the length of line in some of the manuscripts which we know to have been transcribed for Arethas' library, the Bodleian \nEuclid\n, for example. Several of A's omissions, however, are of 23–5 letters in length, corresponding to the 24 (23) letters dropped by both P and A in Book v. 8. It is tempting to suppose that 23–5 was the length of line in an early stage of the text, since it is common in many papyrus rolls of the second century \na.d.\n The fact, however, that the one omission common to A. and P (v. 8) is supplied from the X excerpts might be held to show that this oversight belongs to a later period of the transmission. We may perhaps safely use these two \nmoduli\n in an estimate of a given conjectural emendation or supplement, like Gataker's in v. 16. To argue on the basis of either length to the original format of the \nMeditations\n is too hazardous, in view of the variety of lines even in early rolls, much more in the minuscule stage. \n\nAs to the sources of literal corruption in both P and A, and their presumed archetype, the ground here is familiar. The errors are such as are met with in the study of every Greek text, and are abundantly illustrated from the \napparatus criticus\n of modern texts of Marcus. The fact that A rarely writes iota subscript proves that his original was of later date than the iota adscript period. P's occasional omission of iota (it is not always easy to read in the print) points in the same direction. More than one explanation might be suggested for the uncertainty about \n​\nfinal nu in both P and A. It may be due partly to pronunciation, partly to the use of abbreviation in the original, sometimes it is clearly caused by a misunderstanding of the imperatival infinitive. The omission of rubricated capitals or the rubrication of erroneous capitals is very common in A, especially in the later Books. This need not deceive us; it is akin to our modern misprint. More important is the evidence of the existence in the archetype of marginal or interlinear variants. Here and there, these have crept into our manuscripts; there are also a few cases where glosses appear to have been embodied. These are, however, very few, I believe, though many more have been suspected by critics of the Cobet school. These presumed glosses were supposed by Nauck to be the work of a needy schoolmaster (iv. 30); Schenkl discovers occasionally the bowdlerism of a prudish scribe or the reverence of a Christian monk. More than one critic has detected the work of a physician, who doctored his copy with scraps of medical lore. Dr. Rendall has indicated many glosses which he presumes to have arisen in this way. He even suggests (no doubt half playfully) that the great Galen may sometimes have been at his imperial patient's elbow as he worked. One recent critic, presuming these to be glosses, traces the hand of the young doctor Toxites upon the manuscript which he brought to Conrad Gesner. He forgets that A contains the same additions, and that Toxites had no access to that manuscript. \n\nI have spoken above of dislocations of certain places in the text. Gataker expressed the same suspicion in more than one of his notes. He and the great Saumaise in the seventeenth, and Morus in the eighteenth century, suggested transpositions of some shorter passages. Leopold and Schenkl, following Coraes, have made such a change in x. 1, and Dr. Kronenberg has lately proposed one such change, a change which had occurred to myself  \n​\nindependently (vii. 66, 67). I have at a few places adopted the same kind of dangerous remedy. \n\nThe text which is here printed is frankly eclectic. I do not think it is scientific to restore A's text at the expense of P. I have been guided by intrinsic probability where the evidence differs, with a slight predisposition in favour of P. In certain small details of spelling certainty is quite impossible. The method I have followed may be seen in the course of the notes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIII. Printed Editions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle of importance for the text or interpretation of the \nMeditations\n was published for seventy-five years (1559–1634), although the book was read widely and highly esteemed, as is shown by scholars' references to it in their works and correspondence. Casaubon uses it freely in his notes to Persius; both he and Saumaise cite it in their notes to the \nHistoria Augusta\n; Canter made two emendations in his \nNovae Lectiones\n.\n  Barthius refers to the \nMeditations\n frequently in his \nAdversaria\n, and he it was who first expressed the view that what has been preserved is merely a collection of extracts from a lost original.\n\n\nOf close study of the doctrines of Marcus there is, however, no trace in this period, not even in Justus Lipsius' works on Stoicism.\n Naturally he mentions Marcus more than once, but he nowhere manifests an intimacy with the \nMeditations\n, relying upon other sources for the substance of Stoic teaching. It is the same, I think, with Valla and other writers of Stoic-Christian books.\n\n\nThat the \nMeditations\n had many readers is proved by its frequent republication, and by the fact that fifty years \n​\nafter issue copies of Xylander's two editions were already rare, not only in England but also abroad. At Lyons, in 1559, Tornaesius brought out Xylander's Latin translation, with the anonymous version of Marinus' \nLife of Proclus\n; in 1570, in the same city, appeared the first vernacular translation, a version into French, by the learned civilian Pardoux Duprat (1520–1569/70). Zetzner appears to have bought up the 'remainder' sheets of the Basel edition, and published them with a new title-page at Strassburg in 1590.\n At Lyons, in 1626, de la Bottière issued what its title-page suggests to have been an \neditio princeps\n,\n though it is in reality a reproduction of the 1559 edition (including many of the misprints already corrected by the Basel edition), with a few modifications of the Greek text and Latin translation. The novelty is that Xylander's Latin is printed \nvis-à-vis\n the Greek, and the Books are for the first time divided into \nnumbered\n chapters, though Xylander had indicated the divisions, for the most part, without numbering them. \nMarcus\n was accompanied by \nMarinus\n, but the sub-title seems to indicate that the demand was for the \nMeditations\n, 'a work of importance to Morals, now first published with a Latin translation opposite to the Greek text'. This Lyons edition, with its handful of notes by Amadeus Saly, obstructed rather than cleared the path of scholars. Gataker pays the book much severe and ironical attention. The text of Casaubon's edition suffers, because he was obliged, \nfaute de mieux\n, to use it as his copy for the press. Only here and there have editors adopted some obvious correction \n​\nfirst made by its editor. Thus, besides the \neditio princeps\n, which Gataker did not possess, but first saw when Meric Casaubon called upon him, the Basel edition, which Gataker printed, with marginal corrections (sometimes based on fresh corruptions in the Basel text), and the Strassburg reissue, with which Saumaise worked, an editor has to take into consideration this Lyons text and translation, which rests on no fresh evidence and has no value, critical or evidential. \n\nA fresh impetus to the study and interpretation of Marcus was given by Meric Casaubon's English translation, dedicated to Archbishop Laud, 1634.\n The valuable introduction gives reasons, directed against Xylander (who considered the traditional text to be mutilated) and some unnamed critics (who held the theory of 'excerpts'), for believing that the \nMeditations\n has been preserved intact. By the latter, no doubt, Casaubon intended especially Barthius, who is referred to later on in the introduction with veiled censure: 'I know not any that hath had more to doe with Antoninus than Barthius in his Adversaria: I will not say to what purpose.' Casaubon also criticized Xylander's version, in many places, with vehemence.\n At the end are detailed notes upon the Greek text of the first two Books, with cursory reflections upon the remainder. \n\nThe interpretation of Marcus is very much aided by the grouping together of chapters which Casaubon recognized to be closely related in argument, and by the paraphrases introduced between brackets, to assist a reader. It is to \n​\nthis translation that Gataker refers in his own notes, turning Casaubon's English version as exactly as he could into his own Latin. \n\nIn 1643 followed Casaubon's edition of the Greek text, with an amended form of Xylander's Latin version.\n Casaubon based his text upon Xylander's two editions, the Lyons edition, and a collation of the Munich MS., Mo 2, prepared for him by the learned Hoeschel at Augsburg, where the manuscript or manuscripts then were. The editor states his disappointment, on looking through his father's papers and copy of \nMarcus\n, not to have found the learned notes he had expected. With modest candour he explains that he had postponed his own intended edition on hearing that Thomas Gataker (4 Sept. 1574–27 July 1654) was engaged in the same task. He waited some time, at last procured an introduction, and called on Gataker in May 1642. After some talk he was shown two stout manuscript volumes, the one with the Greek text, a Latin translation, and marginalia, the other a prolix commentary, both ready for the press. They had been completed some time past, but Gataker despaired, in those dark days, of finding printer or publisher. His generous host urged Casaubon to proceed with his proposed edition. Casaubon had already translated the book, was a facile writer, and did not project anything on a scale beyond his powers and his little leisure. His edition came out within twelve months. The work is slight but estimable, for the editor was well versed in pagan and Christian literature, and therefore interprets Marcus with a wide vision. He also made many emendations which have been adopted by successive editors. The book is still of interest, but has been obscured by Gataker's great work, so much so that \n​\neven Hallam writes of Gataker's edition as the first English commentary upon Marcus Aurelius. \n\nThis train of events will explain how it is that Gataker, in his notes, refers to Casaubon's English translation, not to his Greek text, and is often in doubt as to what text Casaubon intended to adopt. It makes obvious too the reason why Gataker published as his own many emendations already, when his book came out, made by Casaubon and actually printed. \n\nCasaubon, as a High Churchman, was deprived of his ecclesiastical preferments by the faction in power in 1644; but Gataker, though one of the Puritan clergy who signed the address (18 Jan. 1649) against the trial of King Charles, did not relinquish his benefice.\n In 1652 the energy of his Cambridge friends procured the publication by the University of his master work.\n\n\nOf this judicious and masculine performance it is difficult to speak with sober moderation. It is a monument of vast and fastidious erudition in the four tongues, and (like his \nCinnus\n, 1651, and posthumous \nAdversaria Miscellanea\n, 1659) a magazine of comprehensive and precise knowledge. Gataker wrote much besides, not least his balanced contribution to the vexed problem of the \nStyle of the New Testament\n, 1648; and posterity has praised his commentaries on \nIsaiah\n, 1645, and \nJeremiah and the Lamentations\n, 1651, his share in the puritan \nNotes upon the Bible\n. For ten years Preacher to Lincoln's Inn, he was Rector of Rotherhithe, near London, until his death, and was an active and moderate member, from 1643 to 1645, of the Westminster Assembly which drew up the Confession of \n​\nFaith, 1647, Above all, he was a faithful minister of the Gospel. To quote a poet with whom he was clearly familiar: \n\n\n\n\n\nBut riche he was of holy thoght and werk.\n\nHe was also a lerned man, a clerk,\n\nThat Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche;\n\nHis parisshens devoutly wolde he teche.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevoted as he was in his daily ministrations, his sermons are models of learning and exposition, enriched with wealth of marginal annotation. It is wonderful how he found the time to achieve, besides all this, an edition of Marcus Aurelius, so vast in its compass, so varied and exact in detail. \n\nReaders familiar with the classical commentaries of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries will recall the repeated reference to Tho. Gataker, the frequent illustrations drawn from his notes.\n Ingram Bywater, inaugurating his tenure of the Greek Chair at Oxford, 1893–1908, said: 'the great Greek scholar of the Caroline age (i.e. in England) is, I think, beyond a doubt Gataker, whose Antoninus is to this day a book of unquestioned value and authority'. Bywater had just been speaking of Sir Henry Savile's \nChrysostom\n and of Selden's \nMarmor Parium\n. Porson refers to 'our Cambridge Gataker, that scholar of vast erudition', touching characteristically, in passing, on a weak joint in the giant's harness, his defective sense of Greek prosody. \n\nThe edition offers a much improved text, conjecturally supplies some gaps in the traditional text, and makes an occasional transposition. It has been criticized as too free in conjecture; but the proposals are always in the margin or the notes, and are not so hazardous as those of Saumaise. In the margin too are careful cross-references, like those \n​\nin the Authorized Version of the Bible; they are invaluable for the elucidation of the subject-matter. Opposite the Greek text is an entirely new Latin version, very close and accurate. There follows a continuous commentary, with scrupulous inquiry into the work of earlier interpreters, explanations of the technical terms and phrases, parallels from authors, ancient and modern, and many references to the Sacred Scriptures. The sources of Marcus' sayings are indicated and his doctrine illustrated. The chronological and material background is filled in from historical documents and literary evidence. In passing, Gataker proposes many palmary emendations of the authors, sacred and profane, whose works he quotes. \n\nThe notes are enriched by communications made to Gataker by Saumaise, Patrick Young (Junius), the Biblical scholar and King's librarian, and by Arnold Boot, a learned Dutchman, a physician who was the friend of Archbishop Ussher. Besides all this, there are copious indexes and a preface with a study of the Stoic philosophy, and a generous but judicious comparison of the moral teaching of Marcus Aurelius with that of Christianity. The preface closes with the words: 'this dissertation, such as it is, with eyes clouded by old age and troubled with rheum, a hand trembling with the frost and sickness (as I had no secretary to assist me), I have heaped together rather than composed, scribbled rather than written this poor work, in Surrey, in the parish of Redrith (Rotherhithe), a suburb of my native city London, in January, in a severe winter, twin brother to the winter of old age and weakness, in the year of salvation 1651, the seventy-eighth of my life'. \n\nThese sad lines will explain how it was that Gataker had little or no part in seeing the volume through the press. The reader will condone a few blemishes upon so vast a performance, mistaken references (few in all) from one part of the book to another, occasional inexactitudes and \n​\nsome misprints, hardly any of which, it must be said, are corrected in the later issues.\n\n\nGataker's edition has long been, and will always remain, the principal authority for any one undertaking to study or edit the \nMeditations\n. \n\nCasaubon's edition was never reprinted, but his notes with Xylander's were annexed to the Utrecht edition of Gataker; his text and Latin translation were reprinted at Oxford, 1680, with a few selections from Xylander's and Gataker's notes. Gataker's edition was reprinted at London, 1697 and 1707, with a life of Marcus by G. Stanhope and notes selected from the D'Aciers' French translation of 1690–1. At Utrecht appeared a splendidly printed reissue, 1697 (Gataker's \nOpera Critica\n followed in 1698), the Greek citations in Gataker's notes being translated into Latin. This, the last edition, includes, in the \nOpera Critica\n, a reprint of Gataker's autobiography, with a further account of his life by his son Charles. \n\nGataker's text and translation, with very brief extracts from his notes and Casaubon's, were reprinted at Oxford, 1704. The editor, R.I.\n, has added a few good remarks. The text and translation also appeared at Leipsic, 1729, with a good summary of Marcus' philosophy by Budde, and a life by Wolle. The text and translation were again published at Glasgow (Foulis), 1744 and 1751, and at Leipsic 1775.\n This last issue is memorable for the brief notes and emendations appended by S. F. N. Morus, and the consequent text became a kind of \nauthorized version\n until the end of the nineteenth century. \n\nCasaubon had consulted one manuscript of the X \n​\nfamily of excerpts (Mo 2), which is nearly related to A. \n\nLucas Holste\n (1596–1661) of Hamburg, the learned custos first of the Barberini collection, then of the Vatican Library, was meanwhile visiting Oxford, Paris, and Florence, studying manuscripts, primarily for his edition of the Greek geographers. When in France he bought the Lyons edition of \nMarcus\n and \nMarinus\n, and discovering in Florence that the \nLife of Proclus\n was existent in its complete form, he contemplated editing both works. He made a proposal to the Elzevirs\n in 1636 for an edition of the \nMeditations\n, to be accompanied by other authors. He was a man of larger projects than performance, and only a part of his store of learning was published by himself or posthumously. In the case of the \nMeditations\n, he may have abandoned his project when Gataker's edition appeared. His \nadversaria\n on Marcus and Marinus are noted in his copy of the Lyons text, which is now in the Bodleian, a part of the D'Orville purchase of 1805. He has collated the text of the \nMeditations\n with a manuscript of the X excerpts at Florence, L. 4\n, and the Marinus text with Med. Laur. LXXXVI. 3, which he elsewhere says is 'the \n​\nbest manuscript I have collated, and I have collated many'.\n He has corrected the faulty Lyons text from Xylander and Casaubon, and freely revised the Latin version.\n There is also a full list of the Suidas extracts, and many parallels from Greek literature are noted. His own emendations, at more than one place, anticipate those of later critics. He does not mention Vaticanus A; but at one place he enters a variant which must be derived from that manuscript, viz. \nἐπὶ τὰ\n for \nἔπειτα\n, xii. 30. \n\nIn 1675 Holste's friend and patron Cardinal Francesco Barberini,\n nephew of Urban VIII, published an Italian version of the \nXII Books of M. Aurelius Antoninus\n.\n He notes at the end a number of variants from Vaticanus A, and I have thought it possible that Holste drew his attention to the manuscript when he had himself abandoned his projected edition. The book was part of Stefano Gradi's collection,\n and did not come into the Vatican until after Barberini's death. \n\nIn the second half of the eighteenth century J. P. de Joly, whose work is described below,\n obtained a collation of Vat. Gr. 1950 (A), from Winckelmann, by permission of Cardinal Alexandre Albani. He also secured collations of five of the Vatican excerpts, and of three Laurentian. He himself consulted Par. 2649. The results he published \n​\nin his Greek text of 1775,\n which was accompanied by Gataker's translation. \n\nThe path indicated by an amateur was now pursued by professed scholars. J. M. Schultz had published an excellent German translation with occasional critical notes, Schleswig, 1799; a Greek text, with Latin version, followed, 1802.\n He corrected the vulgate text by the help of A, one or more of the Paris excerpta, four Laurentian excerpts, and Guelferbytanus 77 (G). He also first published Menage's and Reiske's \nadversaria\n. \n\nSchultz's edition was unfavourably, even harshly, reviewed, and he expresses his chagrin in the sad preface to his second edition, Leipsic, 1820. The text he then gives is much improved, but he follows Coray's edition, almost slavishly. His text was stereotyped by Tauchnitz, 1829, and was for long a familiar edition. Its readings are adopted in the Didot edition, 1840, with little change. \n\nIn 1816 a greater scholar, the Greek patriot Adamantios Coraês, issued a revised text, being volume iv of his \nParerga\n for the Chian society. His introduction, in modern Greek, gives an account of the Emperor's precepts, with a brief bibliography (Gataker, Leipsic, 1775, and Schultz).\n In the footnotes he merely gives his corrections, which are based upon A, and his own conjectures, the book being a school edition. Many solecisms are removed from the previously accepted text, good readings are adopted from A, and his own emendations are most \n​\nfelicitous. After Casaubon, Gataker, and Reiske, he has done far the most to establish a sound text. \n\nThe eccentric edition of the younger Capel Lofft followed in 1861.\n It was not noticed until Dr. Rendall drew attention to its merits. Lofft gives a perfect swarm of emendations, followed by a second set in the appendix. Recent editors have adopted some of his suggestions, and his very audacity often draws attention to textual problems which may easily be overlooked. \n\nIn 1882 Johann Stich\n published a text, with a critical introduction and an \napparatus criticus\n of the now familiar type. He added a considerable index. For his edition he himself first collated M1 and M2, Barberinus, and Mo 2. He omitted the C group, though Cramer had published a collation of C at Oxford in 1839. A second edition, with a new preface, bringing the history of criticism up to date, followed in 1903, but his excellent text he left substantially as in his first edition. His tendency is to prefer the readings of A, where tenable, without exaggeration. He recorded all Nauck's corrections. \n\nIn the present century four editions of the text have succeeded to Stich's, viz. I. H. Leopold, Oxford, 1908; H. Schenkl (ed. major et minor), Teubner, Leipsic, 1913; A. I. Trannoy's text, with French \nvis-à-vis\n, Paris, 1925; \n​\nC. R. Haines, \nThe Communings with Himself of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus\n, Loeb, London, 1916. One further manuscript of the X group, Vat. Gr. 2231 (V 6), was described and collated by Weyland, just after Schenkl's text was published, in 1914. \n\nLeopold's text is eclectic, as indeed any text of Marcus must be with our present evidence. He appears to attach more weight to P than Stich or Schenkl were inclined to do. More than once he leaves corrupt places with no indication of their precarious condition. The brief \napparatus criticus\n pays excessive attention to recent emendations, especially by Englishmen; perhaps he wished to pay a compliment to English work. Schenkl has banished most conjectures and many variant readings to a supplement. His preface, \napparatus criticus\n, and supplement give a very full account of the manuscripts and his opinion of their value and interrelation. He divided the chapters, for reference purposes, into a very large number of sections (here he is followed by M. Trannoy). A most valuable index follows. The distinctive feature of Schenkl's text is his determined predilection for A. He follows this manuscript, even where it appears to have been corrupted by familiar causes, easily illustrated from itself. Moreover, he has a strong fancy to construct readings which contaminate P and A, where these authorities differ. The result is a text which differs from Leopold's in at least 180 places, not counting \nminutiae\n of orthography. His own conjectures are usually recorded in the \napparatus criticus\n, and he speaks very modestly about them. Neither in his \nEpictetus\n nor in his \nMarcus Antoninus\n does he show himself a master of conjecture,\n but scholars will be grateful for the immense labour he gave to these two tasks of his youth and age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n​\nM. Trannoy's edition, with a translation into French \nvis-à-vis\n, Bude, 1925, was preluded by five pamphlets on the text, containing a liberal number of emendations.\n Some of these have been adopted in the Budé edition, others he has later relinquished overtly, or has tacitly abandoned. The \napparatus criticus\n follows Schenkl's report of the manuscripts closely, and contains in consequence some inaccuracies. A few emendations by M. Mondry Beaudouin are recorded. M. A. Puech's preface is brilliant, and there follows an interesting introduction on the Stoic doctrine and the manuscript evidence by M. Trannoy. The character of the Loeb series did not allow Mr. Haines to indulge in a full \napparatus criticus\n. He has a few emendations, and an independent and exact translation into English. There are valuable historical notes and a good index to the subject-matter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIX. Translations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nMeditations\n have been more often translated than edited. Wickham Legg\n has printed a list of texts and translations down to 1908. He says: 'Translations into Latin, English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and the Norse languages are extant. But besides these we have versions into Czech, Polish, and Russian, and even into Persian.' He gives a list of thirty-six such translators, and adds: 'we have amongst his editors a Roman prelate like Cardinal Francis Barberini; a non-juring bishop like Jeremy Collier; a prosperous Dean like Dr. George Stanhope; seventeenth century scholars like Meric Casaubon and Gataker, with Dacier and his wife; a mere theologian like Grabe; a \nlieutenant des chasses\n like de Joly; a time-server like Thomas Rousseau; and we may contrast amongst editors a visionary like the younger Capel Lofft \n​\n. . .\n with a real Stoic, like George Long'.\n He adds: 'the 17th century produced some 26 editions or issues; the eighteenth 58, the 19th 81, while the 20th during the eight years of its existence has already brought forth 28.'\n\nThe bare enumeration shows the extraordinary favour which has been paid to Marcus' book. Many great names too are connected with it. Sir Thomas Browne used the \nMeditations\n, and refers to it directly in one quaint sentence. The sublime passage in Pascal about the two infinities was probably suggested by Marcus' well-known words.\n Pope used the \nMeditations\n, in Jeremy Collier's translation, for his \nEssay on Man\n; Bolingbroke refers to the last chapter, not naming it, in \nThe Spirit of Patriotism\n: 'Whether the piece be of three or five acts, the part may be long'. Legg reports a lithographed book at Munich containing nearly a hundred pages of selections made by Maximilian the Second, King of Bavaria. But a more famous name connected with the \nMeditations\n is that of Frederick the Great of Prussia. He made a paraphrase of its chief doctrines in \nLe Stoicien\n, and he continually refers to Marcus in his writings and correspondence.\n He thought that the book is suited for hours of disappointment and sorrow, to fortify man's courage. Goethe knew the book, and often speaks of it in his correspondence; he was especially interested in Marcus' acknowledgement of indebtedness to his teachers in Book 1. He showed sympathy with Stoical teaching from his early days, and the frequent reminder in his poems that doing, not being, is man's \n​\nduty is derived from this school, if not necessarily from Marcus.\n\nOf more recent books Maeterlinck's \nSagesse et Destinée\n continually refers to the \nMeditations\n, but in other writers the debt is not so easy to trace with confidence. What is more important is the effect upon the circle of everyday readers. Dr. Rendall has said: 'Translations, essays, and the records of biographies all testify how simple and learned alike fall under his spell.' I remember to have read that in 1914, when the news arrived that the Germans had broken faith and violated the frontier of Belgium, the United States Minister to the court of King Albert drove into the countryside to reflect upon the crisis, taking with him the \nMeditations\n of Marcus Aurelius.\n In view of the wide interest taken in the book and its teaching, it is surprising that there should be no modern exegetical commentary upon the \nMeditations\n since 1652, as we have no modern commentary upon Epictetus, since Upton's of 1741 and Schweighäuser's of 1799. It has been left to the historians of philosophy to reconstruct the broad lines of Stoicism, so that, although the text of these two writers has been so carefully and thoroughly explored, little direct commentary upon detailed problems is available to the student. My friend Hastings Crossley, in England, had indeed contemplated an edition of \nMarcus\n, but his delicate health only permitted the publication of one Book.\n Besides this work much valuable and exact criticism of the \nMeditations\n may be found in Paul Fournier's edition of Couat's translation,\n as well as in Dr. Rendall's and Mr. J. Jackson's versions of the book. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n​\n\n\nX. The Form and Contents of the\n \nMeditations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question we are now to ask can, within the limits of an introduction, be indicated but briefly; it is a question that forces itself upon a reader, fascinating him by its insolubility. \n\nIs the book which now lies before us the authentic original, or has what Marcus wrote survived only in an incomplete and mutilated form? So many of the writings of classical antiquity have perished entirely or have been carried down by the river of time in a fragmentary or abbreviated condition, that a similar misfortune may certainly have befallen the Emperor's work.\n\n\nThe form of the \nMeditations\n is incomplete; sometimes, at least on first perusal, incoherent. Books, chapters even, are not clearly and certainly divided from one another, neither are they always concerned with distinct problems; their present arrangement seems artificially (or should we say artlessly) imposed. The Books, if we except the first, possibly the first three, are a broken series of meditations, like improvisations upon themes in a variety of keys, where similar, even identical, motives recur to a listener's confusion. The subjects shift also so abruptly that connexion is hard to distinguish, even in quite brief phrases. Then, again, a sequence will be interrupted by a theme which appears irrelevant, something strayed from an alien context. Finally, a thought will be repeated, for no obvious reason, in a place hardly removed from that in which it made its last appearance. \n\nThe explanation usually given, and now generally accepted, for this disorder and inconsequence is that accident has preserved a private journal, the record of the odd \n​\nmoments of leisure of a busy public man, a philosophical \naide-mémoire\n intended for his own sole use and guidance. What consecutiveness there is, is the sequence of occasion, not subject, and the occasions can only, at best, be divined. \n\nThus Gataker\n contrasts Arrian's \nMemoirs\n, which profess to be notes of lectures, with the discourses of Marcus: 'which were plainly taken from his own notebooks, as the Proverbs of the wise King of Israel were copied largely from his autographs by the amanuenses of King Hezekiah'.\n 'It was', he continues, 'this great man's practice, engaged as he was, whether in peace or war, with his pursuit of philosophy, to note down on paper what occurred to him, not consistently observing any continuous series of subjects, but jotting them down, for one reason or another, according to the times and places in which they occurred to his mind or memory. Consequently, they are very often disconnected; identical reflexions are frequently repeated, as they more frequently come to mind, and most of them are expressed not merely briefly, but even incompletely \n. . .\n there is just enough to refresh and support the memory in topics so familiar. They are designed principally for his own use; thus some are grammatically imperfect, many introduced without any formal preparation.' \n\nIn this way Gataker explains the frequent obscurities, the many uncertainties as to the meaning and bearing of single sayings. The clue to the writer's immediate purpose is lost for want of sufficient knowledge of the occasion which prompted his expression. 'Thus the suspicion that some have entertained of mutilation and corruption are not justified; the text is, as a rule, pure, genuine and entire, surviving in the authentic form in which it originally flowed from the author's pen.'\n \n​\nMeric Casaubon's contention in the \nPreface\n to his English translation and the \nProlegomena\n to his Greek edition agrees in the main with Gataker's judgement. For the difficulties of interpretation he gives two additional reasons. The disconnectedness, he suggests, is inseparable from the style which Marcus adopted, the manner of writing in aphorisms; the obscurity is due to the wealth of quotation from older authors or of allusions to their works; Marcus refers briefly to what he knew intimately from his wide reading, but we, without the originals, do not follow his meaning. Sometimes, too, Marcus seems inconsistent with himself, where he is in fact stating briefly an opinion with which he does not agree. Many difficulties Casaubon condones because 'what Antoninus wrote, he wrote it not for the publick, but for his owne private use'. \n\nHe appears, however, to regard the \nMeditations\n as more continuous and connected than Gataker's words would imply them to be. He assumes longer trains of reasoning, and shows this by his grouping of the chapters, a continuity disguised by the aphoristic form into which the thoughts are thrown. \n\nAn entirely different view of the origin and present form of the \nMeditations\n was taken from the first; and this view has since been advocated more than once. The hypothesis is twofold: it is contended that Marcus designed and did in fact compose a regular moral treatise, and, secondly, that all we now possess is, upon that assumption, an assemblage of the scattered members of a lost original. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n​\nAlready Casaubon refers to 'the opinion of those who have judged that these xii Books are merely excerpts and eclogues from an ampler and more perfect work'. He does not say who these critics were; and, although he occasionally refers to Xylander as though he were one of them, 'excerpts and eclogues' sounds as if he were aiming at Barthius, who held this opinion. \n\nWhether there were others, as Casaubon implies, or not, Barthius\n had said: 'The Florida or Eclogues, should you use that term, which have reached us from the books of the Emperor Antoninus are heavenly.' Moreover, he continually referred to our present text as 'the Excerpts from Antoninus'. \n\nThis opinion he founds upon internal and external evidence. The form of such chapters as the first of Book i he takes to be plain proof of an excerptor's work, where 'neither head nor foot appears'. His external ground is one of which Joly later was to make use, the existence 'in Italy of written exemplars, which are designated Eclogues out of the Book to Himself'. The manuscripts Barthius had clearly not himself examined, for he rests his statement on Conrad Gesner's entry in his \nBibliotheca Universalis\n,\n but does not cite that entry exactly. Nor does he go closely into the serious question he has raised, being content with a loose comparison of Marcus' work with the \nFlorida\n of Apuleius. \n\nIn 1742 Jean-Pierre de Joly published anonymously \nRéflexions de l'Empereur Marc-Aurèle Antonin\n, the whole rearranged by subjects in thirty-six sections. He used the translation of M. and Mme d'Acier. Later, continuing his study and reflecting upon the origin of the \nMeditations\n, he published in 1770 a new French \n​\ntranslation, distributed into thirty-five sections, with a valuable bibliography and notes on the manuscript sources. This was followed in 1774 by his revised Greek text, with Gataker's translation, and a similar rearrangement by subjects. \n\nHis theory is that Marcus had, during his campaigns, composed a moral treatise upon a series of tablets; after his death, these were distributed to relatives and friends, and treasured by them as relics of their admired sovereign. In this way the entirety of the work was dismembered from the first. Later on, some editor made the best collection he could of these Sibylline leaves, and so they were copied out, as they now appear in the Vatican MS., continuously and in disorder, with no indication of Books or subjects. Joly believed that the survival of the X excerpts, in a somewhat different order (they begin with chapters from Book vii, in an inverse sequence), was confirmatory of his view. He regarded the arrangement by Books in the manuscript from which the first edition was printed with suspicion. \n\nJoly produced a more or less orderly composition under titles; he did in fact, though he does not suggest the analogy, what a succession of editors have attempted to do for Pascal's \nPensées\n, he reassembled the \nMeditations\n into a kind of Apology for Stoicism. \n\nFew critics have accepted Joly's hypothesis, although similar attempts have since been made from time to time, with the inevitable divergent results. As to his theory of the cause of the dispersion of the parts, there is no evidence of a Greek book, at this date certainly, being preserved thus upon a series of wax tablets, consisting of pieces of such divergent lengths, and presumably docketed by subjects. One would suppose that the notes would have been transferred by Marcus' secretary to a roll or codex at some \nearly stage of his work. \n\nBut there are two difficulties which appear insuperable \n​\nwhen the results achieved by this method are considered. The new or revived \nMeditations\n are not in fact a continuous treatise, neither is the confusion and repetition of the actual book removed. The new order appears less explicable, fairly judged, than the old. The second difficulty is that, in this new construction, the passages now juxtaposed do not agree in composition with that of their neighbours: passages which in the present text are closely connected, either in subject or in verbal expression, or in both, have become widely sundered. To take two crucial instances, the sections of the present Book i, with their evident order and purpose, are now parcelled out in a different order and under more than one heading. Again the last chapter of Book xii, which has every indication of a designed close, is removed elsewhere, connected indeed with cognate reflections, but robbed of its natural intention and effect.\n\n\nThe latest attempt in this manner is M. Gustav Loisel's \nA moi-même\n,\n an arrangement this time in twelve Books. The \nMeditations\n so presented are interesting to read, and the editor throws light on the mind of Marcus by his work; but it is difficult to accept his results or his further contention that Marcus has left the clue to the order of his work. In his candid preface M. Loisel has recorded M. Haussoulier's critique of his work and it is, I think, conclusive. May we not say that he has done for Marcus, what was done by Budde\n with no idea of reproducing a lost original? He has enabled us to view together under subject-headings,\n a variety of attempts made by \n​\nMarcus to meet his most pressing difficulties, to comment upon his reading of history, to summarize his own experiences, and to provide wholesome precepts for 'the Conduct of his own life', to use Suidas' title for the work. \n\nThat there is evidence of some such continuity in the \nMeditations\n appears to have been the contention of Braune in an essay which I have not been able to procure.\n Stich refers to this attempt as equally futile with Joly's undertaking. Readers of \nMarius the Epicurean\n will recall a reconstruction of part of Marcus' thought in that romance. Pater introduces it under the guise of a lecture traditionally delivered by Marcus in Rome before he set out for his campaign on the Danube.\n This occasion may well have been invented by the biographer who wrote the feeble and mendacious life of Avidius Cassius in the time of Julian (\na.d.\n 360). \n\nMy own opinion is that the order is disturbed, but I have not tried to reconstruct an original of whose existence we have no evidence; I have rather endeavoured to indicate traces of continuity both of subject-matter and verbal expression in the individual parts as they have been preserved to us. \n\nAlthough any attempt to reconstruct an original is doomed to failure, it is certainly conceivable that in the \nMeditations\n we possess the elements of a book which the author had projected, and which death prevented him from completing. It is possible also that not all the passages which have been preserved would have found a place \n \n​\nin the completed book. We may possess portions of composition written at different times with different purposes in view. Apart from the continuity of reflection which I seem to detect in considerable passages, and which would be clearer if we might make some small changes of order in the present text, the general character of the whole is not, fairly viewed, what Gataker has suggested. Many of the chapters are indeed brief memoranda, some are hardly grammatical as they stand, but the greater number are carefully composed and can hardly be designed to recall aspects of a creed already entirely familiar to their author. Again, many maxims have primarily a personal reference, may be private counsels and encouragements, but still more of them impress the reader as addressed, even if unconsciously, to a listener other than Marcus. There is again a whole class of reflections, like Book xi, ch. 18, which might well belong to a hortatory or expository discourse. The brief aphorisms, too, are many of them thrown into a proverbial, sometimes an antithetic form, modelled perhaps on sentences like the traditional words of the Seven Sages or the sayings of Heraclitus and Democritus; their very phrases are chosen with such care and precision as a man hardly uses when recording his thoughts in his own behoof. To take three instances: 'What does not advantage the hive, does not advantage the bee' (vi. 54); 'How many whose praises have been loudly sung are now committed to oblivion; how many who sang their praises are long ago departed' (vii. 6); 'Whosoever does wrong, wrongs himself: whosoever does injustice, does it to himself, making himself evil' (ix. 4). \n\nThen again there are longer passages, scattered through the work, which are essays in little, fastidiously composed to the best of the writer's ability. Here are a few, chosen almost at hazard: on retreat or \nrecueillement\n, iv. 3; lessons from the industry of animals and from the artisan's devotion to his work, v. 1; reflections upon the transitoriness of \n​\nall things created, iv. 33; upon divine dispensation, v. 8; upon Nature's gradual evolution, ix. 9; on human fellowship, xi. 8. These and others, such as reflections upon lives lived fruitlessly or governed by a ruling passion (iv. 32, 48; vi. 47; xii. 27) are hardly to be viewed as personal reminders; rather they are admonitory and consolatory thoughts, statements of religious belief, criticisms upon the vanity of human wishes, all such as might be elements of a book of wholesome doctrine. \n\nTo the two distinct kinds of material corresponds broadly a contrast of style. There are, on the one hand, the unstudied notes, the \naides-mémoire\n or brief hints, which Marcus himself compares to a surgeon's 'first-aid' equipment, aphorisms resembling the well-known \nPrescriptions\n of Hippocrates. These are often bald and simple in shape. Much the larger part, on the other hand, is laboured with care, worked up into something approaching artistic finish. The style is always notably parsimonious, free from rhetorical artifice and, except for an occasional alliteration, brief, succinct, and severe. An extreme case will illustrate my meaning. The chapter upon the Age of the Emperor Augustus (viii. 31) is the quintessence of this studied manner; the effect upon a reader who recalls the long reign, involuntarily contrasting its outward success as recorded on the Monument of Ancyra with its domestic failure, the chagrin and sorrow of the solitary ruler, is overwhelming. Very powerful too is the brief corollary; the thought of Rome's street of tombs, and the melancholy epigram: 'The last of his line'. \n\nSamuel Johnson once said:\n 'I fancy mankind may come in time to write all aphoristically, except in narrative, grow weary of preparation, and connection, and illustration, and all those arts by which a big book is made.' Is not much of the \nMeditations\n an attempt to create a novel form of literature and to find the proper vehicle for its \n​\nexpression? Marcus at times seems to aim at conveying into his Greek sentences something of the lapidary force of the Latin tongue. \n\nAnother mode of composition consists in the rare sentences written in a satiric vein; 'All that comes to pass is as familiar and well-known as the rose in spring and the grape in summer. Of like fashion are sickness, death, calumny, intrigue, and all that gladdens or saddens fools' (iv. 44: cf. v. 33, vi. 13, and the masterly vignette x. 36, and the dialogues, v. 1, 28 and 36). This occasional indulgence of satiric power, so quickly dropped or silenced, gives diversity to the prevailing monochrome; it resembles an artifice of Pascal, whose ironical pictures of men's ambition and distraction are a foil to his religious earnestness. \n\nA study of the \nMeditations\n then, as a whole, suggests a various character of invention, which may be due to a variety of motives in the composition of its parts; that the larger bulk has a decided literary aim appears to me indisputable. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXI. The Actual State of the Work as it has been preserved\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to the \nMeditations\n as we now possess them, what indication of unities or incipient unities of composition do we actually discern? Book i stands by itself, with its clearly defined plan and distinct physiognomy. Only one other passage in the remainder is written in the same style, the duplicate portrait of Antoninus Pius in vi. 30. 2. Book ii, if we omit ch. 10, leaves a strong impression of unity. Book iii again approaches a unity, with a marked close. Further these two Books have, in their headings, definite marks of their place of composition. \n\nThe structure of the remainder is less clearly determined and the distribution into Books, if we had to make it for ourselves, might certainly be altered. Some signs, \n​\nhowever, there are of openings and closes. Thus Book v has a marked beginning and end. The first chapters of Books ix, x, and xi might fairly be taken to be commencements of new reflections; Book viii, however, runs on continuously with the last chapter of Book vii. Of the composite character of Books vii and xi I shall speak when examining the evidence to be derived from the state of the manuscripts. As to the last two Books, with only the contents to guide us we should be led to make a break after xi. 18, and to begin a new Book at xi. 19, which would run to the end of Book xii. \n\nNot necessarily demanding from the author the precision and method of a regular treatise, but assuming a general order in the parts of his book, we are struck by some anomalies. There are passages of considerable length which appear alien in their present context. The most conspicuous is the extract from the \nMoralia\n of Theophrastus, or the paraphrase of his words, at ii. 10, in a Book which has otherwise a distinct and orderly development. Where it now stands, this chapter has a very remote connexion, if any, with what precedes and follows it. Similar passages, or fragments, are the aesthetic essay in iii. 2, possibly the inquiry about Retreat or Retirement at iv. 3; the inquiry into the source of Socrates' moral grandeur, on the basis of Aeschines' dialogue \nTelauges\n, vii. 66; the striking discussion of Tragedy and Comedy, xi. 6. To these we may perhaps add the shorter character of Antoninus Pius, vi. 30. 2. \n\nAll these appear to the reader unexpected in their present places; they are, moreover, somewhat different in complexion and in literary technique from the \nMeditations\n generally. \n\nM. Trannoy\n has discussed some of these digressions. He regards them as strata of earlier composition: 'old notes, grouped in some measure by subjects and utilized \n​\nlater in our work to piece out its somewhat meagre bulk'. But utilized by whom? M. Trannoy evidently considers this patchwork to be due to Marcus himself, not to some hypothetical editor of his remains. \n\nThe disorder in the passages just considered might certainly be explicable in this way, or by Gataker's theory of a mere commonplace book, never rearranged, perhaps not intended to be rearranged. But there is a further difficulty in the present text, which is most simply explained by supposing that the original order has been disturbed. Two paragraphs which appear to be continuous are often sundered by a short and, in the context, quite irrelevant sentence. To give one or two instances. The sequence of iv. 27 and 29 is broken by iv. 28, so much so that Gataker proposed to move iv. 28 to follow and interpret iv. 18. Again, vii. 23 and 25 belong together, while vii. 22 and 24 would make a satisfactory sequence. In Book ix, 13 and 15 are congruous but severed by 14; so 18 and 20, 19 and 21 appear to be closely allied. \n\nThe natural explanation is that displacement of the author's order has occurred, not that Marcus introduced an irrelevance. That such accidents occurred, even in carefully guarded texts like Aristotle's, is well known. Simplicius\n suggests that this has befallen chapters 16, 17, and 18 of Epictetus' \nManual\n, the original order having been 16, 18, 17, and he was writing within a few centuries of its publication. We are not precluded from such an hypothesis in the case of a text whose history extends over thirteen centuries. \n\nThe evidence of the manuscripts, P cod and A, confirms on the whole the impression gained from the study made in the last section. P cod was divided, Xylander tells us, directly or by implication, into twelve Books, with the general title: 'The writings of the Emperor Marcus Antoninus to Himself.' There was one difference in the \n​\nbook division; i closed at ii. 3 and, ii began at the present ii. 4. At the close of i. 17, the words: 'Written among the Quadi, on the Gran' appear in the text, followed by a (viz. a', that is, Book i). This appears to be the title of the present ii, which was originally labelled i. We may surmise that the present first Book once stood apart from the \nMeditations\n proper, being prefixed as an Introduction or, as some think, intended for an Epilogue. Books ii–xii may thus have originally been separate volumes, a distinct book, with a different purpose. \n\nThat the present vii may have once been two Books (in which way the number twelve would be completed) is suggested by a note which has got into the text of the first edition, though missing in A. Book vii, as was remarked above, is at present disordered. After vii. 31 (the end of which is mutilated) follow three chapters labelled: 'On Death', 'On Pain', 'On Glory' (such labels are nowhere else employed by Marcus); then comes a series of extracts from Plato, Euripides, and others, with one or two aphorisms which may be original, vii. 35–51. To this succeed chs. 52–75 in the author's familiar manner of writing. \n\nAt ch. 52 init. a marginal note, as Xylander remarks, had crept into the text of P cod. It runs: 'This is not a beginning but is continuous with the chapters above, which preceded the Plato citations (viz. preceded ch. 35).'\n This would appear to indicate that the original Book ran vii. 1–34 (or 1–31 more probably), 52–75. The evidence of A is perhaps confirmatory. The scribe has left a space of half a line at the end of ch. 51. He begins ch. 52 with a capital, in red, and he found his original obscure. \n\nA more conspicuous case of intrusion will be found at \n​\nthe close of xi. Chapters 22–39 are a mere collection of poetic extracts, anecdotes, and maxims, the latter being summaries of known passages of Epictetus or remarks now generally assigned to him. Nearly all trivial in interest and markedly inferior to the extracts in vii, they have no bearing on what precedes and follows them in the \nMeditations\n. \n\nNor is this all. These fragments break the continuity of xi. 20–1 with xii. 1. Not merely the subject-matter but also the form of language in xii. 1 is closely related to the part of xi which precedes the fragments. Here the scribe of A comes to our assistance. At the end of the extracts he has drawn an asterisk, after which is the entry: 'Of the Emperor Antoninus'. This is the exact form of words which is the heading of the set of excerpts called C. It is reasonable then to suppose that the material of xii was derived from a set of detached folios and that the extracts of which we are speaking are derived from another source and either did not belong to the body of the \nMeditations\n, or at best belonged to a different part of that book. The state of things is at least some evidence of dismemberment or partial dismemberment of the \nMeditations\n. \n\nThe general condition of A, if regarded apart from P, might in itself suggest, as Joly said, that it contains a series of chapters which have survived from a larger and more complete whole. There is no numeration of Books, no title. The chapters are indicated by rubricated letters, but these capital letters are often introduced so as to interrupt the natural sequence of thought. The Books, where they are distinguished, are merely distinguished by an interval of a line or two. If we had only the evidence of A, we should get the following provisional grouping: i, ii. 1–3, ii. 4 to end, iii–iv, v–vi, vii–viii, ix, x–xi, xii, that is to say, nine Books, or a prefatory Book followed by eight Books. We might, therefore surmise that if there were originally twelve Books, as Suidas says there were, three have been lost, and that the original from which both A \n​\nand P are derived was renumbered by the scribe of P cod to give an appearance of a complete twelve Books. \n\nThere is one other disturbing feature in the text as it has reached us. There are some chapters, especially in Book xii, which not only resemble mere notes but are introduced by ὄτι, a well-known sign of an extract in collections of eclogues.\n This is a characteristic of the manuscripts of excerpts from Marcus which are denominated C,\n and the same is true of many of the excerpts of the \nMeditations\n in Suidas. This seems evidence that, before the date of the archetype of our manuscripts, there existed a set of eclogues from the \nMeditations\n which Suidas sometimes drew from. From this the C excerpts which do not precisely follow our present order may have been derived. \n\nThe X excerpts have two remarkable features. They appear to come from a \nFlorilegium\n (which most critics ascribe to Planudes, 13th–14th century) in which extracts from Marcus are mixed with extracts from Appian's book on the \nNature of Animals\n, for no reason that can be discovered. Their other characteristic is that they do not follow the present order of the text. They begin with passages from Book vii arranged in inverse order.\n This, so far as it goes, points to Book vii, which we have seen to be of a composite arrangement, having once had a different order of chapters and possibly a different position in some earlier manuscript. The state of the excerpts generally does seem to suggest that our present manuscripts (as their internal evidence at two points indicates) were at some time assembled from sheets which had fallen into disorder. \n\nTwo other lines of inquiry occur to one as possible. First, in chapters which so often refer to experiences in \n​\nthe author's life, we might expect to find definite historical allusions which should fix the order in which individual passages were composed, and in this way determine the periods in which the Books were written. Secondly, the same problem might be resolved by the manner of writing used by the author, that is either by stylistic evidence, or by the way in which he treats his subjects of contemplation. Both these lines of investigation have been pursued, but neither with any definite result.\n\n\nMr. Haines's summary of the two inquiries arrives at the conclusion that the \nMeditations\n were 'composed as a connected whole, Books ii–xii being written consecutively in that order and Book i added afterwards as an introduction.' The dates which he tentatively suggests are: \n\n\n\n\n\nBook ii written in the land of the Quadi, \na.d.\n 171–2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook iii at Carnuntum, \na.d.\n 172–3. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks iv–viii at the front, \na.d.\n 173–5. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks ix–x during the revolt of Cassius, \na.d.\n 175–6. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks xi–xii at Rome before Marcus went North, \na.d.\n 178. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook i written in or shortly after \na.d.\n 178. \n\n\n\n\n\nI have discussed some of these questions in the introduction to the several Books; here it is enough to say that the results attained are extremely doubtful, and are reached only by minimizing the negative instances. In fact the only certain points are that the whole work was clearly written towards the end of the life of Marcus, certainly after his accession to the throne, and, as to details, that the death of Domitia Lucilla (\ncirca\n \na.d.\n 156) is mentioned in i. 17. 7, and implied in viii. 25 and ix. 21; that Marcus alludes to Lucius Aurelius Verus' death (\na.d.\n 169) as some time past in viii. 37; that Marcus probably refers to his title Sarmaticus (\na.d.\n 175) in x. 10; that he certainly \n​\nappears to refer in ix. 3 to the approaching birth of a child, and that his youngest child was born in \na.d.\n 166–7. As to the composition of Book i the reasoning is hazardous in the extreme. There is the reference to Alexander the Platonist (i. 12), who is thought to have become Greek secretary about \na.d.\n 174, but who is in this chapter classed as a teacher, with the other teachers of an earlier date; and there is the mention of Faustina in i. 17. 8, which would naturally be taken to imply that she was alive when it was written. The only ground advanced for a late date is that the sketch of Pius in vi. 30. 2 is shorter than that in i. 16, and so more likely to be written later than \na.d.\n 174, about which time Book vi is dated. \n\nAs Mr. Haines says, as much may be said against as for Breithaupt's reasoning from the \nmanner\n of composition, viz. that, assuming the present order of the Books, subjects of composition are treated more briefly when they recur. To me iv. 3. 2–3 would appear, by itself, fatal to Breithaupt's argument, for there seven favourite positions of the writer are enunciated for the first time, in the curtest fashion, and they are all treated later at various places and at considerable length. Such a passage shows that the statements of doctrine rest upon lessons accepted by the writer before he began to compose, as we should expect from their nature would be the case. When these points arise, as they do from time to time, the development of them is longer or shorter according to the mood and interest of the moment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXII. Comparison of the\n \nMeditations\n \nwith other Books of Spiritual Consolation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conclusion that a study of the \nMeditations\n from its various sides has led me tentatively to adopt is that the book enshrines a variety of reflections gradually accumulated over a period of some ten to fifteen years, and governed by the idea of producing a work of consolation \n​\nand encouragement; it is the deposit of those quiet hours when, as Marcus says, he left his stepmother, the Palace, to set up his rest with his own mother, Philosophy (vi. 12). His retirement from public affairs was not spent in the contemplation of a mystic, rather he began at first to record for his own use those short elementary maxims of his faith and practice (iv. 3). Later he was led to expand, with a larger view, what he began for his own service. He desired to point his fellows to the City of God, which is the reality in what seems a world of coming into being and quickly passing away. That he was in fact occupied with some literary and philosophic attempt seems indicated by that one passage in which he has definitely referred to this side of his life: 'You are now', he says, 'not likely to read your Memoranda, your Deeds of Greece and Rome, the Extracts you made and laid up against old age' (iii. 14). To this variety of past and present activity he may again allude where he says: 'Put away your volumes' and 'Cast out your appetite for books' (ii. 2 and 3). \nMemoranda\n is the diminutive form of the word he himself employs for Epictetus' \nMemoirs\n,\n which Arrian himself uses to describe that work, and which is used by Galen and others for works of considerable compass. 'Memoranda and Extracts' covers the substance of the \nMeditations\n as they have come down to us. \n\nAfter the death of the Emperor in March \na.d.\n 180, an editor, perhaps Marcus' Greek secretary Alexander,\n may have made a selection from the literary remains. The partial disorder would be explicable in one of three ways: the editor may have followed, without readjustment, the incomplete and unarranged rolls to which he had access; \n​\nagain, he may have put them together into an order which satisfied himself but is not satisfactory to us; or again, the publication may have originally been more regular, and since have suffered dislocation and occasional truncation in the course of transmission. \n\nPerhaps the likeliest hypothesis, as it is the simplest, is that the editor recorded religiously what he had to his hand, misunderstanding sometimes notes which marked passages not destined for their present context, sometimes embodying at the wrong place marginal additions. Sentences are undoubtedly left standing now which appear to belong to a different order of thought and purpose from their neighbours, perhaps even from the main collection. \n\nThis explanation certainly assumes what cannot be proved. Indeed it is contrary to the opinion of Gataker and other critics, probably also to the sense of an ordinary reader, for it implies that Marcus was occupied with a work which he intended some day to publish. In favour of this explanation are the traces in what we possess of a unity, especially the completed first Book, the nearly finished Books ii and iii, the other incipient unities, and the conclusion of Book xii. The difficulty which will be felt is that the tenour of so much of the writing is as of a soliloquy, not intended to be overheard. This may be met in part by supposing that the original purpose was to fortify the writer's own heart and mind, and that this only gradually expanded itself to a wider ambit, an address to his fellow men. Marcus has hit upon a form of self-expression not previously used in Greek letters, and has written a manual of admonitions useful for the philosophic life, Spiritual Consolations, in fact a \nReligio Imperatoris\n. He is gradually feeling his way to the right expressional use of his new instrument, and has often failed to reach the final and sufficient shape. \n\nA clue to the origin of the \nMeditations\n is furnished by another work of similar form and content, whose genesis \n​\nwe are acquainted with. I do not mean St. Augustine's \nConfessions\n or the famous book of Jean Jacques Rousseau, with which the \nMeditations\n is sometimes compared, but a considerable book, which appears to have grown up, in a similar way to this one, in the busy loneliness of the Chartreuse. The thoughts of Guigue, 5th Prior (born \na.d.\n 1083, elected \na.d.\n 1110), have at last been printed in their original order and completeness.\n They reveal a series of religious musings: 'not a treatise nor the scraps of a treatise, not an autobiography, but the sequence of the Prior's reflexions, written scrupulously but with no affectation, in order to see clearly into himself, and to seek humbly in the strength of his God a sure refuge for his own frailty'.\n From the context it is clear that Dom Wilmart, as he penned this sentence, was conscious of the striking resemblance in manner and motive of Guigue to the Roman Emperor. In what follows he again writes in terms closely applicable to the Book we are considering: 'Guigue, when he likes, knows well how to pursue a train of argument \n. . .\n yet his habitual taste is for sentences more or less brief, where he endeavours to present an original thought, to enunciate a true maxim, suggest an antithesis, outline a miniature.' A further resemblance between the Prior of the Chartreuse and Marcus consists in their occasional references to experiences of their own life, with here and there the mention of a contemporary by name, for instance the Prior's namesake, the Baron Guigo. \n\nThe \nMeditations\n might then be taken as an exactly similar book,\n with a parallel genesis, and, with the necessary allowances, much the same outlook upon experience. \n​\nA closer analogue is another book better known to most English readers. This is Sir Thomas Browne's \nReligio Medici\n. The learned Norwich physician tells us of his famous essay: 'This I confess \n. . .\n for my private exercise and satisfaction, I had at leisurable hours composed.' Criticism he disarms by the excuse: 'being a private Exercise directed to my self, what is delivered therein, was rather a Memorial unto me, than an Example or Rule unto any other.'\n\n\n'Directed to myself', 'a Memorial unto me';—the terms might be thought a reminiscence, they are certainly a happy rendering, of Marcus' \nΤὰ εἰς Ἑαυτόν\n, 'his meditations concerning Himself'. Like Marcus too the 'whimsical Knight' had his commonplace books, the armoury upon which he drew for this work and his \nChristian Morals\n. \n\nStill more to the point is an even more famous writing, Blaise Pascal's \nPensées\n. Left incomplete and in fragments at his death, it at length came out, with considerable expense to order and textual integrity, in the Port Royal edition, put together in a manner believed to agree with the dead man's purpose. However it be arranged, and arrangements have been many, the sense of the several paragraphs, the \nliaison\n of argument, the precise point of those occasional barbed shafts of incomparable irony, can, at least by the ordinary reader, be now surmised and no more. Pascal's general aim is easy to detect, if we have sympathy with him and even dimly share his faith, but the whole is there in promise only, not in performance. I have often entertained the thought that the \nMeditations\n grew up like the \nPensées\n, that Marcus had in mind a Defence of Philosophic Belief which he had neither leisure nor ability to complete. \n\nPascal's \nPensées\n are incomplete and isolated fragments, some written by himself, some dictated, the whole edited and published by other hands. Did the same fate overtake \n​\nthe Emperor's tablets and rolls, corrected perhaps already at some places by himself? We shall never know. All things considered, it appears reasonable to conjecture that an effort was made to collect faithfully what was thought to be best worth preserving, to respect the autographs or originals, to leave alone the repetitions, interruptions, digressions, even the inconsequences; to rearrange but little. If so, what we have may be no more than a selection, collected and arranged by an editor very much in its present shape.\n The unity which runs through the whole arises from the rare sincerity and earnestness of the writer; what is logically inconsequent leaves behind a sense of continuity; as we read, many anomalies become intelligible, many hard places plain, though some will still be dark, even insoluble. But even so, with the injuries, dealt by the hand of time and by the misunderstandings of copyists, the unfinished pages are not incomplete. The merit and charm of Marcus is that, wherever you take him up and whenever you lay him down, you have had communion with a wise and chastened temper, faithful to its prescribed limits, always consistent in itself. 'It is not like acting and dancing, where the whole, if you interrupt it, is ruined. In every act and wherever surprised, the soul has made what it purposed entire, and nowhere deficient; so that it can say: \nI possess what is my own' \n (xi. 1. 1). The radiance of a lofty and humble spirit illuminates these sentences, as the sun lights up and blends the coloured fragments of an ancient window. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n​\n\n\nA.

See Schenkl, \nEpict.\n (1894), pp. lxxii (Schenkl, \nM. Ant.\n p. v), lxxvi, lxxix, lxxxiii. The MS. actually has \nἈντώνινος\n for \nἈντωνῖνος\n in each case, a scribal error which occurs, e.g. in the title of the Marcus \nExcerpts\n, X vat. 6, \nμάρκου ἀντωνίου αὐτοκράτορος ἐκ τῶν εἰς ἐαυτόν\n (Weyland, \nBerlin, pb.

Annius Verus, and he was sprung of a noble family which claimed descent from Numa, second King of Rome. Thus the most religious of emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings. His father, Annius Verus, had held high office in Rome, and his grandfather, of the same name, had been thrice Consul. Both his parents died young, but Marcus held them in loving remembrance. On his father's death Marcus was adopted by his grandfather, the consular Annius Verus, and there was deep love between these two. On the very first page of his book Marcus gratefully declares how of his grandfather he had learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion. The Emperor Hadrian divined the fine character of the lad, whom he used to call not Verus but Verissimus, more Truthful than his own name. He advanced Marcus to equestrian rank when six years of age, and at the age of eight made him a member of the ancient Salian priesthood. The boy's aunt, Annia Galeria Faustina, was married to Antoninus Pius, afterwards emperor. Hence it came about that Antoninus, having no son, adopted Marcus, changing his name to that which he is known by, and betrothed him to his daughter Faustina. His education was conducted with all care. The ablest teachers were engaged for him, and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the Stoic philosophy, which was his great delight. He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to avoid all softness and luxury. His body was trained to hardihood by wrestling, hunting, and outdoor games; and though his constitution was weak, he showed great personal courage to encounter the fiercest boars. At the same time he was kept from the extravagancies of his day. The great excitement in Rome was the strife of the Factions, as they were called, in the circus. The racing drivers used to adopt one of four colours - red, blue, white, or green - and their partisans showed an eagerness in supporting them which nothing could surpass. Riot and corruption went in the train of the racing chariots; and from all these things Marcus held severely aloof.\n\nIn 140 Marcus was raised to the consulship, and in 145 his betrothal was consummated by marriage. Two years later Faustina brought him a daughter; and soon after the tribunate and other imperial honours were conferred upon him.\n\nAntoninus Pius died in 161, and Marcus assumed the imperial state. He at once associated with himself L. Ceionius Commodus, whom Antoninus had adopted as a younger son at the same time with Marcus, giving him the name of Lucius Aurelius Verus. Henceforth the two are colleagues in the empire, the junior being trained as it were to succeed. No sooner was Marcus settled upon the throne than wars broke out on all sides. In the east, Vologeses III. of Parthia began a long-meditated revolt by destroying a whole Roman Legion and invading Syria (162). Verus was sent off in hot haste to quell this rising; and he fulfilled his trust by plunging into drunkenness and debauchery, while the war was left to his officers. Soon after Marcus had to face a more serious danger at home in the coalition of several powerful tribes on the northern frontier. Chief among those were the Marcomanni or Marchmen, the Quadi (mentioned in this book), the Sarmatians, the Catti, the Jazyges. In Rome itself there was pestilence and starvation, the one brought from the east by Verus's legions, the other caused by floods which had destroyed vast quantities of grain. After all had been done possible to allay famine and to supply pressing needs - Marcus being forced even to sell the imperial jewels to find money - both emperors set forth to a struggle which was to continue more or less during the rest of Marcus's reign. During these wars, in 169, Verus died. We have no means of following the campaigns in detail; but thus much is certain, that in the end the Romans succeeded in crushing the barbarian tribes, and effecting a settlement which made the empire more secure. Marcus was himself commander-in-chief, and victory was due no less to his own ability than to his wisdom in choice of lieutenants, shown conspicuously in the case of Pertinax. There were several important battles fought in these campaigns; and one of them has become celebrated for the legend of the Thundering Legion. In a battle against the Quadi in 174, the day seemed to be going in favour of the foe, when on a sudden arose a great storm of thunder and rain; the lightning struck the barbarians with terror, and they turned to rout. In later days this storm was said to have been sent in answer to the prayers of a legion which contained many Christians, and the name Thundering Legion should be given to it on this account. The title of Thundering Legion is known at an earlier date, so this part of the story at least cannot be true; but the aid of the storm is acknowledged by one of the scenes carved on Antonine's Column at Rome, which commemorates these wars.\n\nThe settlement made after these troubles might have been more satisfactory but for an unexpected rising in the east. Avidius Cassius, an able captain who had won renown in the Parthian wars, was at this time chief governor of the eastern provinces. By whatever means induced, he had conceived the project of proclaiming himself emperor as soon as Marcus, who was then in feeble health, should die; and a report having been conveyed to him that Marcus was dead, Cassius did as he had planned. Marcus, on hearing the news, immediately patched up a peace and returned home to meet this new peril. The emperor's great grief was that he must needs engage in the horrors of civil strife. He praised the qualities of Cassius and expressed a heartfelt wish that Cassius might not be driven to do himself a hurt before he should have the opportunity to grant a free pardon. But before he could come to the east, news had come to Cassius that the emperor still lived; his followers fell away from him, and he was assassinated. Marcus now went to the east, and while there, the murderers brought the head of Cassius to him; but the emperor indignantly refused their gift, nor would he admit the men to his presence.\n\nOn this journey his wife, Faustina, died. At his return the emperor celebrated a triumph (176). Immediately afterwards he repaired to Germany, and took up once more the burden of war. His operations were followed by complete success; but the troubles of late years had been too much for his constitution, at no time robust, and on March 17, 180, he died in Pannonia.\n\nThe good emperor was not spared domestic troubles. Faustina had borne him several children of whom he was passionately fond. Their innocent faces may still be seen in many a sculpture gallery, recalling with odd effect the dreamy countenance of their father. But they died one by one, and when Marcus came to his own end only one of his sons still lived—the weak and worthless Commodus. On his father's death, Commodus, who succeeded him, undid the work of many campaigns by a hasty and unwise peace; and his reign of twelve years proved him to be a ferocious and bloodthirsty tyrant. Scandal has made free with the name of Faustina herself, who is accused not only of unfaithfulness, but of intriguing with Cassius and egging him on to his fatal rebellion.  It must be admitted that these charges rest on no sure evidence; and the emperor, at all events, loved her dearly, nor ever felt the slightest qualm of suspicion.\n\nAs a soldier we have seen that Marcus was both capable and successful; as an administrator he was prudent and conscientious. Although steeped in the teachings of philosophy, he did not attempt to remodel the world on any preconceived plan. He trod the path beaten by his predecessors, seeking only to do his duty as well as he could, and to keep out corruption. He did some unwise things, it is true. To create a compeer in empire, as he did with Verus, was a dangerous innovation which could only succeed if one of the two effaced himself; and under Diocletian this very precedent caused the Roman Empire to split into halves. He erred in his civil administration by too much centralising. But the strong point of his reign was the administration of justice. Marcus sought by-laws to protect the weak, to make the lot of the slaves less hard, to stand in place of father to the fatherless. Charitable foundations were endowed for rearing and educating poor children. The provinces were protected against oppression, and public help was given to cities or districts which might be visited by calamity. The great blot on his name, and one hard indeed to explain, is his treatment of the Christians. In his reign Justin at Rome became a martyr to his faith, and Polycarp at Smyrna, and we know of many outbreaks of fanaticism in the provinces which caused the death of the faithful. It is no excuse to plead that he knew nothing about the atrocities done in his name: it was his duty to know, and if he did not he would have been the first to confess that he had failed in his duty. But from his own tone in speaking of the Christians it is clear he knew them only from calumny; and we hear of no measures taken even to secure that they should have a fair hearing. In this respect Trajan was better than he.\n\nTo a thoughtful mind such a religion as that of Rome would give small satisfaction. Its legends were often childish or impossible; its teaching had little to do with morality. The Roman religion was in fact of the nature of a bargain: men paid certain sacrifices and rites, and the gods granted their favour, irrespective of right or wrong. In this case all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy, as they had been, though to a less extent, in Greece. There were under the early empire two rival schools which practically divided the field between them, Stoicism and Epicureanism. The ideal set before each was nominally much the same. The Stoics aspired to the repression of all emotion, and the Epicureans to freedom from all disturbance; yet in the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn endurance, the other for unbridled licence. With Epicureanism we have nothing to do now; but it will be worth while to sketch the history and tenets of the Stoic sect. Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, was born in Cyprus at some date unknown, but his life may be said roughly to be between the years 350 and 250 B.C. Cyprus has been from time immemorial a meeting-place of the East and West, and although we cannot grant any importance to a possible strain of Phoenician blood in him (for the Phoenicians were no philosophers), yet it is quite likely that through Asia Minor he may have come in touch with the Far East. He studied under the cynic Crates, but he did not neglect other philosophical systems. After many years' study he opened his own school in a colonnade in Athens called the Painted Porch, or Stoa, which gave the Stoics their name. Next to Zeno, the School of the Porch owes most to Chrysippus (280 - 207 B.C.), who organised Stoicism into a system. Of him it was said,\n\n'But for Chrysippus, there had been no Porch.'\n\nThe Stoics regarded speculation as a means to an end and that end was, as Zeno put it, to live consistently (ὁμολογουμένος ζῆν) or as it was later explained, to live in conformity with nature (ὁμολογουμένος τῇ φύσει ζῆν). This conforming of the life to nature was the Stoic idea of Virtue.\n\nThis dictum might easily be taken to mean that virtue consists in yielding to each natural impulse; but that was very far from the Stoic meaning. In order to live in accord with nature, it is necessary to know what nature is; and to this end a threefold division of philosophy is made - into Physics, dealing with the universe and its laws, the problems of divine government and teleology; Logic, which trains the mind to discern true from false; and Ethics, which applies the knowledge thus gained and tested to practical life. The Stoic system of physics was materialism with an infusion of pantheism. In contradiction to Plato's view that the Ideas, or Prototypes, of phenomena alone really exist, the Stoics held that material objects alone existed; but immanent in the material universe was a spiritual force which acted through them, manifesting itself under many forms, as fire, aether, spirit, soul, reason, the ruling principle. The universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations; while legends and myths are allegorical. The soul of man is thus an emanation from the godhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. The divine ruling principle makes all things work together for good, but for the good of the whole. The highest good of man is consciously to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense in which the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it is virtue alone which enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soul must rule man.\n\nIn Logic, the Stoic system is noteworthy for their theory as to the test of truth, the Criterion. They compared the new-born soul to a sheet of paper ready for writing. Upon this the senses write their impressions, fantasias and by experience of a number of these the soul unconsciously conceives general notions (κοιναὶ ἔννοιαι) or anticipations (προλήψεις). When the impression was such as to be irresistible it was called (καταληπτικὴ φαντασία)  one that holds fast, or as they explained it, one proceeding from truth. Ideas and inferences artificially produced by deduction or the like were tested by this 'holding perception.'\n\nOf the Ethical application I have already spoken. The highest good was the virtuous life. Virtue alone is happiness, and vice is unhappiness. Carrying this theory to its extreme, the Stoic said that there could be no gradations between virtue and vice, though of course each has its special manifestations. Moreover, nothing is good but virtue, and nothing but vice is bad. Those outside things which are commonly called good or bad, such as health and sickness, wealth and poverty, pleasure and pain, are to him indifferent (αδιαφορα). All these things are merely the sphere in which virtue may act. The ideal Wise Man is sufficient unto himself in all things, autarkhs and knowing these truths, he will be happy even when stretched upon the rack. It is probable that no Stoic claimed for himself that he was this Wise Man, but that each strove after it as an ideal much as the Christian strives after a likeness to Christ. The exaggeration in this statement was, however, so obvious, that the later Stoics were driven to make a further subdivision of things indifferent into what is preferable (προηγμένα) and what is undesirable (ἀποπροηγμένα). They also held that for him who had not attained to the perfect wisdom, certain actions were proper (καθήκοντα). These were neither virtuous nor vicious, but, like the indifferent things, held a middle place.\n\nTwo points in the Stoic system deserve special mention. One is a careful distinction between things which are in our power and things which are not. Desire and dislike, opinion and affection, are within the power of the will; whereas health, wealth, honour, and other such are generally not so. The Stoic was called upon to control his desires and affections, and to guide his opinion; to bring his whole being under the sway of the will or leading principle, just as the universe is guided and governed by divine Providence. This is a special application of the favourite Greek virtue of moderation (σωφροσύνη), and has also its parallel in Christian ethics. The second point is a strong insistence on the unity of the universe, and on man's duty as part of a great whole. Public spirit was the most splendid political virtue of the ancient world, and it is here made cosmopolitan. It is again instructive to note that Christian sages insisted on the same thing. Christians are taught that they are members of a worldwide brotherhood, where is neither Greek nor Hebrew, bond nor free and that they live their lives as fellowworkers with God. Such is the system which underlies the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. Some knowledge of it is necessary to the right understanding of the book, but for us the chief interest lies elsewhere. We do not come to Marcus Aurelius for a treatise on Stoicism. He is no head of a school to lay down a body of doctrine for students; he does not even contemplate that others should read what he writes. His philosophy is not an eager intellectual inquiry, but more what we should call religious feeling. The uncompromising stiffness of Zeno or Chrysippus is softened and transformed by passing through a nature reverent and tolerant, gentle and free from guile; the grim resignation which made life possible to the Stoic sage becomes in him almost a mood of aspiration. His book records the innermost thoughts of his heart, set down to ease it, with such moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of duty and the countless annoyances of a busy life.\n\nIt is instructive to compare the Meditations with another famous book, the Imitation of Christ. There is the same ideal of self-control in both. It should be a man's task, says the Imitation, 'to overcome himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.' 'In withstanding of the passions standeth very peace of heart.' 'Let us set the axe to the root, that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind.' To this end there must be continual self-examination. 'If thou may not continually gather thyself together, namely sometimes do it, at least once a day, the morning or the evening. In the morning purpose, in the evening discuss the manner, what thou hast been this day, in word, work, and thought.' But while the Roman's temper is a modest self-reliance, the Christian aims at a more passive mood, humbleness and meekness, and reliance on the presence and personal friendship of God. The Roman scrutinises his faults with severity, but without the self-contempt which makes the Christian 'vile in his own sight.' The Christian, like the Roman, bids 'study to withdraw thine heart from the love of things visible'; but it is not the busy life of duty he has in mind so much as the contempt of all worldly things, and the 'cutting away of all lower delectations.' Both rate men's praise or blame at their real worthlessness; 'Let not thy peace,' says the Christian, 'be in the mouths of men.' But it is to God's censure the Christian appeals, the Roman to his own soul. The petty annoyances of injustice or unkindness are looked on by each with the same magnanimity. 'Why doth a little thing said or done against thee make thee sorry? It is no new thing; it is not the first, nor shall it be the last, if thou live long. At best suffer patiently, if thou canst not suffer joyously.' The Christian should sorrow more for other men's malice than for our own wrongs; but the Roman is inclined to wash his hands of the offender. 'Study to be patient in suffering and bearing other men's defaults and all manner infirmities,' says the Christian; but the Roman would never have thought to add, 'If all men were perfect, what had we then to suffer of other men for God?' The virtue of suffering in itself is an idea which does not meet us in the Meditations. Both alike realise that man is one of a great community. 'No man is sufficient to himself,' says the Christian; 'we must bear together, help together, comfort together.' But while he sees a chief importance in zeal, in exalted emotion that is, and avoidance of lukewarmness, the Roman thought mainly of the duty to be done as well as might be, and less of the feeling which should go with the doing of it. To the saint as to the emperor, the world is a poor thing at best. 'Verily it is a misery to live upon the earth,' says the Christian; few and evil are the days of man's life, which passeth away suddenly as a shadow.\n\nBut there is one great difference between the two books we are considering. The Imitation is addressed to others, the Meditations by the writer to himself. We learn nothing from the Imitation of the author's own life, except in so far as he may be assumed to have practised his own preachings; the Meditations reflect mood by mood the mind of him who wrote them. In their intimacy and frankness lies their great charm. These notes are not sermons; they are not even confessions. There is always an air of self-consciousness in confessions; in such revelations there is always a danger of unctuousness or of vulgarity for the best of men. St. Augustine is not always clear of offence, and John Bunyan himself exaggerates venial peccadilloes into heinous sins. But Marcus Aurelius is neither vulgar nor unctuous; he extenuates nothing, but nothing sets down in malice. He never poses before an audience; he may not be profound, he is always sincere. And it is a lofty and serene soul which is here disclosed before us. Vulgar vices seem to have no temptation for him; this is not one tied and bound with chains which he strives to break. The faults he detects in himself are often such as most men would have no eyes to see. To serve the divine spirit which is implanted within him, a man must 'keep himself pure from all violent passion and evil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all manner of discontent, either in regard of the gods or men': or, as he says elsewhere, 'unspotted by pleasure, undaunted by pain.' Unwavering courtesy and consideration are his aims. 'Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, thou must be good;' 'doth any man offend? It is against himself that he doth offend: why should it trouble thee?' The offender needs pity, not wrath; those who must needs be corrected, should be treated with tact and gentleness; and one must be always ready to learn better. 'The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them.' There are so many hints of offence forgiven, that we may believe the notes followed sharp on the facts. Perhaps he has fallen short of his aim, and thus seeks to call his principles to mind, and to strengthen himself for the future. That these sayings are not mere talk is plain from the story of Avidius Cassius, who would have usurped his imperial throne. Thus the emperor faithfully carries out his own principle, that evil must be overcome with good. For each fault in others, Nature (says he) has given us a counteracting virtue; 'as, for example, against the unthankful, it hath given goodness and meekness, as an antidote.'\n\nOne so gentle towards a foe was sure to be a good friend; and indeed his pages are full of generous gratitude to those who had served him. In his First Book he sets down to account all the debts due to his kinsfolk and teachers. To his grandfather he owed his own gentle spirit, to his father shamefastness and courage; he learnt of his mother to be religious and bountiful and single-minded. Rusticus did not work in vain, if he showed his pupil that his life needed amending. Apollonius taught him simplicity, reasonableness, gratitude, a love of true liberty. So the list runs on; every one he had dealings with seems to have given him something good, a sure proof of the goodness of his nature, which thought no evil.\n\nIf his was that honest and true heart which is the Christian ideal, this is the more wonderful in that he lacked the faith which makes Christians strong. He could say, it is true, 'either there is a God, and then all is well; or if all things go by chance and fortune, yet mayest thou use thine own providence in those things that concern thee properly; and then art thou well.' Or again, 'We must needs grant that there is a nature that doth govern the universe.' But his own part in the scheme of things is so small, that he does not hope for any personal happiness beyond what a serene soul may win in this mortal life. 'O my soul, the time I trust will be, when thou shalt be good, simple, more open and visible, than that body by which it is enclosed;' but this is said of the calm contentment with human lot which he hopes to attain, not of a time when the trammels of the body shall be cast off. For the rest, the world and its fame and wealth, 'all is vanity.' The gods may perhaps have a particular care for him, but their especial care is for the universe at large: thus much should suffice. His gods are better than the Stoic gods, who sit aloof from all human things, untroubled and uncaring, but his personal hope is hardly stronger. On this point he says little, though there are many allusions to death as the natural end; doubtless he expected his soul one day to be absorbed into the universal soul, since nothing comes out of nothing, and nothing can be annihilated. His mood is one of strenuous weariness; he does his duty as a good soldier, waiting for the sound of the trumpet which shall sound the retreat; he has not that cheerful confidence which led Socrates through a life no less noble, to a death which was to bring him into the company of gods he had worshipped and men whom he had revered.\n\nBut although Marcus Aurelius may have held intellectually that his soul was destined to be absorbed, and to lose consciousness of itself, there were times when he felt, as all who hold it must sometimes feel, how unsatisfying is such a creed. Then he gropes blindly after something less empty and vain. 'Thou hast taken ship,' he says, 'thou hast sailed, thou art come to land, go out, if to another life, there also shalt thou find gods, who are everywhere.' There is more in this than the assumption of a rival theory for argument's sake. If worldly things 'be but as a dream, the thought is not far off that there may be an awakening to what is real. When he speaks of death as a necessary change, and points out that nothing useful and profitable can be brought about without change, did he perhaps think of the change in a corn of wheat, which is not quickened except it die? Nature's marvellous power of recreating out of Corruption is surely not confined to bodily things. Many of his thoughts sound like far-off echoes of St. Paul; and it is strange indeed that this most Christian of emperors has nothing good to say of the Christians. To him they are only sectaries 'violently and passionately set upon opposition'. Profound as philosophy these Meditations certainly are not; but Marcus Aurelius was too sincere not to see the essence of such things as came within his experience. Ancient religions were for the most part concerned with outward things. Do the necessary rites, and you propitiate the gods; and these rites were often trivial, sometimes violated right feeling or even morality. Even when the gods stood on the side of righteousness, they were concerned with the act more than with the intent. But Marcus Aurelius knows that what the heart is full of, the man will do. 'Such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are,' he says, 'such will thy mind be in time.' And every page of the book shows us that he knew thought was sure to issue in act. He drills his soul, as it were, in right principles, that when the time comes, it may be guided by them. To wait until the emergency is to be too late. He sees also the true essence of happiness. 'If happiness did consist in pleasure, how came notorious robbers, impure abominable livers, parricides, and tyrants, in so large a measure to have their part of pleasures?' He who had all the world's pleasures at command can write thus 'A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the soul, good desires, good actions.'\n\nBy the irony of fate this man, so gentle and good, so desirous of quiet joys and a mind free from care, was set at the head of the Roman Empire when great dangers threatened from east and west. For several years he himself commanded his armies in chief. In camp before the Quadi he dates the first book of his Meditations, and shows how he could retire within himself amid the coarse clangour of arms. The pomps and glories which he despised were all his; what to most men is an ambition or a dream, to him was a round of weary tasks which nothing but the stern sense of duty could carry him through. And he did his work well. His wars were slow and tedious, but successful. With a statesman's wisdom he foresaw the danger to Rome of the barbarian hordes from the north, and took measures to meet it. As it was, his settlement gave two centuries of respite to the Roman Empire; had he fulfilled the plan of pushing the imperial frontiers to the Elbe, which seems to have been in his mind, much more might have been accomplished. But death cut short his designs.\n\nTruly a rare opportunity was given to Marcus Aurelius of showing what the mind can do in despite of circumstances. Most peaceful of warriors, a magnificent monarch whose ideal was quiet happiness in home life, bent to obscurity yet born to greatness, the loving father of children who died young or turned out hateful, his life was one paradox. That nothing might lack, it was in camp before the face of the enemy that he passed away and went to his own place.\n\nTranslations\n\nTHE following is a list of the chief English translations of Marcus Aurelius: (1) By Meric Casaubon, 1634; (2) Jeremy Collier, 1701; (3) James Thomson, 1747; (4) R.

Num. xlviii. Whensoever thou wilt rejoice thyself, think and meditate upon those good parts and especial gifts, which thou hast observed in any of them that live with thee: as industry in one, in another modesty, in another bountifulness, in another some other thing. For nothing can so much rejoice thee, as the resemblances and parallels of several virtues, eminent in the dispositions of them that live with thee, especially when all at once, as it were, they represent themselves unto thee. See therefore, that thou have them always in a readiness.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST BOOK\n\n\nI. Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion. From the fame and memory of him that begot me I have learned both shamefastness and manlike behaviour. Of my mother I have learned to be religious, and bountiful; and to forbear, not only to do, but to intend any evil; to content myself with a spare diet, and to fly all such excess as is incidental to great wealth. Of my great-grandfather, both to frequent public schools and auditories, and to get me good and able teachers at home; and that I ought not to think much, if upon such occasions, I were at excessive charges.\n\nII. Of him that brought me up, not to be fondly addicted to either of the two great factions of the coursers in the circus, called Prasini, and Veneti: nor in the amphitheatre partially to favour any of the gladiators, or fencers, as either the Parmularii, or the Secutores. Moreover, to endure labour; nor to need many things; when I have anything to do, to do it myself rather than by others; not to meddle with many businesses; and not easily to admit of any slander.\n\nIII. Of Diognetus, not to busy myself about vain things, and not easily to believe those things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon them to work wonders, and by sorcerers, or prestidigitators, and impostors; concerning the power of charms, and their driving out of demons, or evil spirits; and the like. Not to keep quails for the game; nor to be mad after such things. Not to be offended with other men's liberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy. Him also I must thank, that ever I heard first Bacchius, then Tandasis and Marcianus, and that I did write dialogues in my youth; and that I took liking to the philosophers' little couch and skins, and such other things, which by the Grecian discipline are proper to those who profess philosophy.\n\nIV. To Rusticus I am beholding, that I first entered into the conceit that my life wanted some redress and cure. And then, that I did not fall into the ambition of ordinary sophists, either to write tracts concerning the common theorems, or to exhort men unto virtue and the study of philosophy by public orations; as also that I never by way of ostentation did affect to show myself an active able man, for any kind of bodily exercises. And that I gave over the study of rhetoric and poetry, and of elegant neat language. That I did not use to walk about the house in my long robe, nor to do any such things. Moreover I learned of him to write letters without any affectation, or curiosity; such as that was, which by him was written to my mother from Sinuessa: and to be easy and ready to be reconciled, and well pleased again with them that had offended me, as soon as any of them would be content to seek unto me again. To read with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and superficial knowledge, nor quickly to assent to things commonly spoken of: whom also I must thank that ever I lighted upon Epictetus his Hypomnemata, or moral commentaries and commonefactions: which also he gave me of his own.\n\nV. From Apollonius, true liberty, and unvariable steadfastness, and not to regard anything at all, though never so little, but right and reason: and always, whether in the sharpest pains, or after the loss of a child, or in long diseases, to be still the same man; who also was a present and visible example unto me, that it was possible for the same man to be both vehement and remiss: a man not subject to be vexed, and offended with the incapacity of his scholars and auditors in his lectures and expositions; and a true pattern of a man who of all his good gifts and faculties, least esteemed in himself, that his excellent skill and ability to teach and persuade others the common theorems and maxims of the Stoic philosophy. Of him also I learned how to receive favours and kindnesses (as commonly they are accounted:) from friends, so that I might not become obnoxious unto them, for them, nor more yielding upon occasion, than in right I ought; and yet so that I should not pass them neither, as an unsensible and unthankful man.\n\nVI. Of Sextus, mildness and the pattern of a family governed with paternal affection; and a purpose to live according to nature: to be grave without affectation: to observe carefully the several dispositions of my friends, not to be offended with idiots, nor unseasonably to set upon those that are carried with the vulgar opinions, with the theorems, and tenets of philosophers: his conversation being an example how a man might accommodate himself to all men and companies; so that though his company were sweeter and more pleasing than any flatterer's cogging and fawning; yet was it at the same time most respected and reverenced: who also had a proper happiness and faculty, rationally and methodically to find out, and set in order all necessary determinations and instructions for a man's life. A man without ever the least appearance of anger, or any other passion; able at the same time most exactly to observe the Stoic Apathia, or unpassionateness, and yet to be most tender-hearted: ever of good credit; and yet almost without any noise, or rumour: very learned, and yet making little show.\n\nVii. From Alexander the Grammarian, to be unreprovable myself, and not reproachfully to reprehend any man for a barbarism, or a solecism, or any false pronunciation, but dextrously by way of answer, or testimony, or confirmation of the same matter (taking no notice of the word) to utter it as it should have been spoken; or by some other such close and indirect admonition, handsomely and civilly to tell him of it.\n\nVIII. Of Fronto, to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a tyrannous king is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called [Eupatridas Gk.], i.e. nobly born, are in some sort incapable, or void of natural affection.\n\nIX. Of Alexander the Platonic, not often nor without great necessity to say, or to write to any man in a letter, 'I am not at leisure'; nor in this manner still to put off those duties, which we owe to our friends and acquaintances (to every one in his kind) under pretence of urgent affairs.\n\nX. Of Catulus, not to contemn any friend's expostulation, though unjust, but to strive to reduce him to his former disposition: freely and heartily to speak well of all my masters upon any occasion, as it is reported of Domitius, and Athenodotus: and to love my children with true affection.\n\nXI. From my brother Severus, to be kind and loving to all them of my house and family; by whom also I came to the knowledge of Thrasea and Helvidius, and Cato, and Dio, and Brutus. He it was also that did put me in the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth, administered by justice and equality; and of a kingdom wherein should be regarded nothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects. Of him also, to observe a constant tenor, (not interrupted, with any other cares and distractions,) in the study and esteem of philosophy: to be bountiful and liberal in the largest measure; always to hope the best; and to be confident that my friends love me. In whom I moreover observed open dealing towards those whom he reproved at any time, and that his friends might without all doubt or much observation know what he would, or would not, so open and plain was he.\n\nXII. From Claudius Maximus, in all things to endeavour to have power of myself, and in nothing to be carried about; to be cheerful and courageous in all sudden chances and accidents, as in sicknesses: to love mildness, and moderation, and gravity: and to do my business, whatsoever it be, thoroughly, and without querulousness. Whatsoever he said, all men believed him that as he spake, so he thought, and whatsoever he did, that he did it with a good intent. His manner was, never to wonder at anything; never to be in haste, and yet never slow: nor to be perplexed, or dejected, or at any time unseemly, or excessively to laugh: nor to be angry, or suspicious, but ever ready to do good, and to forgive, and to speak truth; and all this, as one that seemed rather of himself to have been straight and right, than ever to have been rectified or redressed; neither was there any man that ever thought himself undervalued by him, or that could find in his heart, to think himself a better man than he. He would also be very pleasant and gracious.\n\nXIII. In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without wavering in those things, which after a due examination and deliberation, he had determined. How free from all vanity he carried himself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are esteemed:) his laboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had aught to say tending to any common good: how generally and impartially he would give every man his due; his skill and knowledge, when rigour or extremity, or when remissness or moderation was in season; how he did abstain from all unchaste love of youths; his moderate condescending to other men's occasions as an ordinary man, neither absolutely requiring of his friends, that they should wait upon him at his ordinary meals, nor that they should of necessity accompany him in his journeys; and that whensoever any business upon some necessary occasions was to be put off and omitted before it could be ended, he was ever found when he went about it again, the same man that he was before. His accurate examination of things in consultations, and patient hearing of others. He would not hastily give over the search of the matter, as one easy to be satisfied with sudden notions and apprehensions. His care to preserve his friends; how neither at any time he would carry himself towards them with disdainful neglect, and grow weary of them; nor yet at any time be madly fond of them. His contented mind in all things, his cheerful countenance, his care to foresee things afar off, and to take order for the least, without any noise or clamour. Moreover how all acclamations and flattery were repressed by him: how carefully he observed all things necessary to the government, and kept an account of the common expenses, and how patiently he did abide that he was reprehended by some for this his strict and rigid kind of dealing. How he was neither a superstitious worshipper of the gods, nor an ambitious pleaser of men, or studious of popular applause; but sober in all things, and everywhere observant of that which was fitting; no affecter of novelties: in those things which conduced to his ease and convenience, (plenty whereof his fortune did afford him,) without pride and bragging, yet with all freedom and liberty: so that as he did freely enjoy them without any anxiety or affectation when they were present; so when absent, he found no want of them. Moreover, that he was never commended by any man, as either a learned acute man, or an obsequious officious man, or a fine orator; but as a ripe mature man, a perfect sound man; one that could not endure to be flattered; able to govern both himself and others. Moreover, how much he did honour all true philosophers, without upbraiding those that were not so; his sociableness, his gracious and delightful conversation, but never unto satiety; his care of his body within bounds and measure, not as one that desired to live long, or over-studious of neatness, and elegancy; and yet not as one that did not regard it: so that through his own care and providence, he seldom needed any inward physic, or outward applications: but especially how ingeniously he would yield to any that had obtained any peculiar faculty, as either eloquence, or the knowledge of the laws, or of ancient customs, or the like; and how he concurred with them, in his best care and endeavour that every one of them might in his kind, for that wherein he excelled, be regarded and esteemed: and although he did all things carefully after the ancient customs of his forefathers, yet even of this was he not desirous that men should take notice, that he did imitate ancient customs. Again, how he was not easily moved and tossed up and down, but loved to be constant, both in the same places and businesses; and how after his great fits of headache he would return fresh and vigorous to his wonted affairs. Again, that secrets he neither had many, nor often, and such only as concerned public matters: his discretion and moderation, in exhibiting of the public sights and shows for the pleasure and pastime of the people: in public buildings, congiaries, and the like. In all these things, having a respect unto men only as men, and to the equity of the things themselves, and not unto the glory that might follow. Never wont to use the baths at unseasonable hours; no builder; never curious, or solicitous, either about his meat, or about the workmanship, or colour of his clothes, or about anything that belonged to external beauty. In all his conversation, far from all inhumanity, all boldness, and incivility, all greediness and impetuosity; never doing anything with such earnestness, and intention, that a man could say of him, that he did sweat about it: but contrariwise, all things distinctly, as at leisure; without trouble; orderly, soundly, and agreeably. A man might have applied that to him, which is recorded of Socrates, that he knew how to want, and to enjoy those things, in the want whereof, most men show themselves weak; and in the fruition, intemperate: but to hold out firm and constant, and to keep within the compass of true moderation and sobriety in either estate, is proper to a man, who hath a perfect and invincible soul; such as he showed himself in the sickness of Maximus.\n\nXIV. From the gods I received that I had good grandfathers, and parents, a good sister, good masters, good domestics, loving kinsmen, almost all that I have; and that I never through haste and rashness transgressed against any of them, notwithstanding that my disposition was such, as that such a thing (if occasion had been) might very well have been committed by me, but that It was the mercy of the gods, to prevent such a concurring of matters and occasions, as might make me to incur this blame. That I was not long brought up by the concubine of my father; that I preserved the flower of my youth. That I took not upon me to be a man before my time, but rather put it off longer than I needed. That I lived under the government of my lord and father, who would take away from me all pride and vainglory, and reduce me to that conceit and opinion that it was not impossible for a prince to live in the court without a troop of guards and followers, extraordinary apparel, such and such torches and statues, and other like particulars of state and magnificence; but that a man may reduce and contract himself almost to the state of a private man, and yet for all that not to become the more base and remiss in those public matters and affairs, wherein power and authority is requisite. That I have had such a brother, who by his own example might stir me up to think of myself; and by his respect and love, delight and please me. That I have got ingenuous children, and that they were not born distorted, nor with any other natural deformity. That I was no great proficient in the study of rhetoric and poetry, and of other faculties, which perchance I might have dwelt upon, if I had found myself to go on in them with success. That I did by times prefer those, by whom I was brought up, to such places and dignities, which they seemed unto me most to desire; and that I did not put them off with hope and expectation, that (since that they were yet but young) I would do the same hereafter. That I ever knew Apollonius and Rusticus, and Maximus. That I have had occasion often and effectually to consider and meditate with myself, concerning that life which is according to nature, what the nature and manner of it is: so that as for the gods and such suggestions, helps and inspirations, as might be expected from them, nothing did hinder, but that I might have begun long before to live according to nature; or that even now that I was not yet partaker and in present possession of that life, that I myself (in that I did not observe those inward motions, and suggestions, yea and almost plain and apparent instructions and admonitions of the gods,) was the only cause of it. That my body in such a life, hath been able to hold out so long. That I never had to do with Benedicta and Theodotus, yea and afterwards when I fell into some fits of love, I was soon cured. That having been often displeased with Rusticus, I never did him anything for which afterwards I had occasion to repent. That it being so that my mother was to die young, yet she lived with me all her latter years. That as often as I had a purpose to help and succour any that either were poor, or fallen into some present necessity, I never was answered by my officers that there was not ready money enough to do it; and that I myself never had occasion to require the like succour from any other. That I have such a wife, so obedient, so loving, so ingenuous. That I had choice of fit and able men, to whom I might commit the bringing up of my children. That by dreams I have received help, as for other things, so in particular, how I might stay my casting of blood, and cure my dizziness, as that also that happened to thee in Cajeta, as unto Chryses when he prayed by the seashore. And when I did first apply myself to philosophy, that I did not fall into the hands of some sophists, or spent my time either in reading the manifold volumes of ordinary philosophers, nor in practising myself in the solution of arguments and fallacies, nor dwelt upon the studies of the meteors, and other natural curiosities. All these things without the assistance of the gods, and fortune, could not have been.\n\nXV. In the country of the Quadi at Granua, these.\n\nBetimes in the morning say to thyself, This day I shalt have to do with an idle curious man, with an unthankful man, a railer, a crafty, false, or an envious man; an unsociable uncharitable man. All these ill qualities have happened unto them, through ignorance of that which is truly good and truly bad. But I that understand the nature of that which is good, that it only is to be desired, and of that which is bad, that it only is truly odious and shameful: who know moreover, that this transgressor, whosoever he be, is my kinsman, not by the same blood and seed, but by participation of the same reason, and of the same divine particle; How can I either be hurt by any of those, since it is not in their power to make me incur anything that is truly reproachful? or angry, and ill affected towards him, who by nature is so near unto me? for we are all born to be fellow-workers, as the feet, the hands, and the eyelids; as the rows of the upper and under teeth: for such therefore to be in opposition, is against nature; and what is it to chafe at, and to be averse from, but to be in opposition?\n\nXVI. Whatsoever I am, is either flesh, or life, or that which we commonly call the mistress and overruling part of man; reason. Away with thy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to and fro; for it will not be; but as even now ready to die, think little of thy flesh: blood, bones, and a skin; a pretty piece of knit and twisted work, consisting of nerves, veins and arteries; think no more of it, than so. And as for thy life, consider what it is; a wind; not one constant wind neither, but every moment of an hour let out, and sucked in again. The third, is thy ruling part; and here consider; Thou art an old man; suffer not that excellent part to be brought in subjection, and to become slavish: suffer it not to be drawn up and down with unreasonable and unsociable lusts and motions, as it were with wires and nerves; suffer it not any more, either to repine at anything now present, or to fear and fly anything to come, which the destiny hath appointed thee.\n\nXVII. Whatsoever proceeds from the gods immediately, that any man will grant totally depends from their divine providence. As for those things that are commonly said to happen by fortune, even those must be conceived to have dependence from nature, or from that first and general connection, and concatenation of all those things, which more apparently by the divine providence are administered and brought to pass. All things flow from thence: and whatsoever it is that is, is both necessary, and conducing to the whole (part of which thou art), and whatsoever it is that is requisite and necessary for the preservation of the general, must of necessity for every particular nature, be good and behoveful. And as for the whole, it is preserved, as by the perpetual mutation and conversion of the simple elements one into another, so also by the mutation, and alteration of things mixed and compounded. Let these things suffice thee; let them be always unto thee, as thy general rules and precepts. As for thy thirst after books, away with it with all speed, that thou die not murmuring and complaining, but truly meek and well satisfied, and from thy heart thankful unto the gods.\n\n\n\nTHE SECOND BOOK\n\n\nI. Remember how long thou hast already put off these things, and how often a certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by the gods, thou hast neglected it. It is high time for thee to understand the true nature both of the world, whereof thou art a part; and of that Lord and Governor of the world, from whom, as a channel from the spring, thou thyself didst flow: and that there is but a certain limit of time appointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of to calm and allay the many distempers of thy soul, it will pass away and thou with it, and never after return.\n\nII. Let it be thy earnest and incessant care as a Roman and a man to perform whatsoever it is that thou art about, with true and unfeigned gravity, natural affection, freedom and justice: and as for all other cares, and imaginations, how thou mayest ease thy mind of them. Which thou shalt do; if thou shalt go about every action as thy last action, free from all vanity, all passionate and wilful aberration from reason, and from all hypocrisy, and self-love, and dislike of those things, which by the fates or appointment of God have happened unto thee. Thou seest that those things, which for a man to hold on in a prosperous course, and to live a divine life, are requisite and necessary, are not many, for the gods will require no more of any man, that shall but keep and observe these things.\n\nIII. Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time for thee to respect thyself, will be at an end. Every man's happiness depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men.\n\nIV Why should any of these things that happen externally, so much distract thee? Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing, and cease roving and wandering to and fro. Thou must also take heed of another kind of wandering, for they are idle in their actions, who toil and labour in this life, and have no certain scope to which to direct all their motions, and desires.\n\nV. For not observing the state of another man's soul, scarce was ever any man known to be unhappy. tell whosoever they be that intend not, and guide not by reason and discretion the motions of their own souls, they must of necessity be unhappy.\n\nVI. These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature of the universe, and what is mine - in particular: This unto that what relation it hath: what kind of part, of what kind of universe it is: And that there is nobody that can hinder thee, but that thou mayest always both do and speak those things which are agreeable to that nature, whereof thou art a part.\n\nVII. Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar sense such things I grant may be compared:) says well and like a philosopher, that those sins are greater which are committed through lust, than those which are committed through anger. For he that is angry seems with a kind of grief and close contraction of himself, to turn away from reason; but he that sins through lust, being overcome by pleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike disposition. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of the two is the more to be condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he that sins with grief. For indeed this latter may seem first to have been wronged, and so in some manner through grief thereof to have been forced to be angry, whereas he who through lust doth commit anything, did of himself merely resolve upon that action.\n\nVIII. Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do, and so project all, as one who, for aught thou knowest, may at this very present depart out of this life. And as for death, if there be any gods, it is no grievous thing to leave the society of men. The gods will do thee no hurt, thou mayest be sure. But if it be so that there be no gods, or that they take no care of the world, why should I desire to live in a world void of gods, and of all divine providence? But gods there be certainly, and they take care for the world; and as for those things which be truly evil, as vice and. wickedness, such things they have put in a man s own power, that he might avoid them if he would: and had there been anything besides that had been truly bad and evil, they would have had a care of that also, that a man might have avoided it. But why should that be thought to hurt and prejudice a man's life in this world, which cannot any ways make man himself the better, or the worse in his own person? Neither must we think that the nature of the universe did either through ignorance pass these things, or if not as ignorant of them, yet as unable either to prevent, or better to order and dispose them. It cannot be that she through want either of power or skill, should have committed such a thing, so as to suffer all things both good and bad, equally and promiscuously, to happen unto all both good and bad. As for life therefore, and death, honour and dishonour, labour and pleasure, riches and poverty, all these things happen unto men indeed, both good and bad, equally; but as things which of themselves are neither good nor bad; because of themselves, neither shameful nor praiseworthy.\n\nIX. Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the bodies and substances themselves, into the matter and substance of the world: and their memories into the general age and time of the world. Consider the nature of all worldly sensible things; of those especially, which either ensnare by pleasure, or for their irksomeness are dreadful, or for their outward lustre and show are in great esteem and request, how vile and contemptible, how base and corruptible, how destitute of all true life and being they are.\n\nX. It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to consider what they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits and voices, honour and credit do proceed: as also what it is to die, and how if a man shall consider this by itself alone, to die, and separate from it in his mind all those things which with it usually represent themselves unto us, he can conceive of it no otherwise, than as of a work of nature, and he that fears any work of nature, is a very child. Now death, it is not only a work of nature, but also conducing to nature.\n\nXI. Consider with thyself how man, and by what part of his, is joined unto God, and how that part of man is affected, when it is said to be diffused. There is nothing more wretched than that soul, which in a kind of circuit compasseth all things, searching (as he saith) even the very depths of the earth; and by all signs and conjectures prying into the very thoughts of other men's souls; and yet of this, is not sensible, that it is sufficient for a man to apply himself wholly, and to confine all his thoughts and cares to the tendance of that spirit which is within him, and truly and really to serve him. His service doth consist in this, that a man keep himself pure from all violent passion and evil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all manner of discontent, either in regard of the gods or men. For indeed whatsoever proceeds from the gods, deserves respect for their worth and excellency; and whatsoever proceeds from men, as they are our kinsmen, should by us be entertained, with love, always; sometimes, as proceeding from their ignorance, of that which is truly good and bad, (a blindness no less, than that by which we are not able to discern between white and black:) with a kind of pity and compassion also.\n\nXII. If thou shouldst live three thousand, or as many as ten thousands of years, yet remember this, that man can part with no life properly, save with that little part of life, which he now lives: and that which he lives, is no other, than that which at every instant he parts with. That then which is longest of duration, and that which is shortest, come both to one effect. For although in regard of that which is already past there may be some inequality, yet that time which is now present and in being, is equal unto all men. And that being it which we part with whensoever we die, it doth manifestly appear, that it can be but a moment of time, that we then part with. For as for that which is either past or to come, a man cannot be said properly to part with it. For how should a man part with that which he hath not? These two things therefore thou must remember. First, that all things in the world from all eternity, by a perpetual revolution of the same times and things ever continued and renewed, are of one kind and nature; so that whether for a hundred or two hundred years only, or for an infinite space of time, a man see those things which are still the same, it can be no matter of great moment. And secondly, that that life which any the longest liver, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and duration the very same, for that only which is present, is that, which either of them can lose, as being that only which they have; for that which he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose.\n\nXIII. Remember that all is but opinion and conceit, for those things are plain and apparent, which were spoken unto Monimus the Cynic; and as plain and apparent is the use that may be made of those things, if that which is true and serious in them, be received as well as that which is sweet and pleasing.\n\nXIV. A man's soul doth wrong and disrespect itself first and especially, when as much as in itself lies it becomes an aposteme, and as it were an excrescency of the world, for to be grieved and displeased with anything that happens in the world, is direct apostacy from the nature of the universe; part of which, all particular natures of the world, are. Secondly, when she either is averse from any man, or led by contrary desires or affections, tending to his hurt and prejudice; such as are the souls of them that are angry. Thirdly, when she is overcome by any pleasure or pain. Fourthly, when she doth dissemble, and covertly and falsely either doth or saith anything. Fifthly, when she doth either affect or endeavour anything to no certain end, but rashly and without due ratiocination and consideration, how consequent or inconsequent it is to the common end. For even the least things ought not to be done, without relation unto the end; and the end of the reasonable creatures is, to follow and obey him, who is the reason as it were, and the law of this great city, and ancient commonwealth.\n\nXV. The time of a man's life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all things belonging to the body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto the soul. Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no better than oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only one thing, philosophy. And philosophy doth consist in this, for a man to preserve that spirit which is within him, from all manner of contumelies and injuries, and above all pains or pleasures; never to do anything either rashly, or feignedly, or hypocritically: wholly to depend from himself and his own proper actions: all things that happen unto him to embrace contentedly, as coming from Him from whom he himself also came; and above all things, with all meekness and a calm cheerfulness, to expect death, as being nothing else but the resolution of those elements, of which every creature is composed. And if the elements themselves suffer nothing by this their perpetual conversion of one into another, that dissolution, and alteration, which is so common unto all, why should it be feared by any? Is not this according to nature? But nothing that is according to nature can be evil.\n\nWhilst I was at Carnuntum.\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIRD BOOK\n\n\nI. A man must not only consider how daily his life wasteth and decreaseth, but this also, that if he live long, he cannot be certain, whether his understanding shall continue so able and sufficient, for either discreet consideration, in matter of businesses; or for contemplation: it being the thing, whereon true knowledge of things both divine and human, doth depend. For if once he shall begin to dote, his respiration, nutrition, his imaginative, and appetitive, and other natural faculties, may still continue the same: he shall find no want of them. But how to make that right use of himself that he should, how to observe exactly in all things that which is right and just, how to redress and rectify all wrong, or sudden apprehensions and imaginations, and even of this particular, whether he should live any longer or no, to consider duly; for all such things, wherein the best strength and vigour of the mind is most requisite; his power and ability will be past and gone. Thou must hasten therefore; not only because thou art every day nearer unto death than other, but also because that intellective faculty in thee, whereby thou art enabled to know the true nature of things, and to order all thy actions by that knowledge, doth daily waste and decay: or, may fail thee before thou die.\n\nII. This also thou must observe, that whatsoever it is that naturally doth happen to things natural, hath somewhat in itself that is pleasing and delightful: as a great loaf when it is baked, some parts of it cleave as it were, and part asunder, and make the crust of it rugged and unequal, and yet those parts of it, though in some sort it be against the art and intention of baking itself, that they are thus cleft and parted, which should have been and were first made all even and uniform, they become it well nevertheless, and have a certain peculiar property, to stir the appetite. So figs are accounted fairest and ripest then, when they begin to shrink, and wither as it were. So ripe olives, when they are next to putrefaction, then are they in their proper beauty. The hanging down of grapes - the brow of a lion, the froth of a foaming wild boar, and many other like things, though by themselves considered, they are far from any beauty, yet because they happen naturally, they both are comely, and delightful; so that if a man shall with a profound mind and apprehension, consider all things in the world, even among all those things which are but mere accessories and natural appendices as it were, there will scarce appear anything unto him, wherein he will not find matter of pleasure and delight. So will he behold with as much pleasure the true rictus of wild beasts, as those which by skilful painters and other artificers are imitated. So will he be able to perceive the proper ripeness and beauty of old age, whether in man or woman: and whatsoever else it is that is beautiful and alluring in whatsoever is, with chaste and continent eyes he will soon find out and discern. Those and many other things will he discern, not credible unto every one, but unto them only who are truly and familiarly acquainted, both with nature itself, and all natural things.\n\nIII. Hippocrates having cured many sicknesses, fell sick himself and died. The Chaldeans and Astrologians having foretold the deaths of divers, were afterwards themselves surprised by the fates. Alexander and Pompeius, and Caius Caesar, having destroyed so many towns, and cut off in the field so many thousands both of horse and foot, yet they themselves at last were fain to part with their own lives. Heraclitus having written so many natural tracts concerning the last and general conflagration of the world, died afterwards all filled with water within, and all bedaubed with dirt and dung without. Lice killed Democritus; and Socrates, another sort of vermin, wicked ungodly men. How then stands the case? Thou hast taken ship, thou hast sailed, thou art come to land, go out, if to another life, there also shalt thou find gods, who are everywhere. If all life and sense shall cease, then shalt thou cease also to be subject to either pains or pleasures ; and to serve and tend this vile cottage; so much the viler, by how much that which ministers unto it doth excel ; the one being a rational substance, and a spirit, the other nothing but earth and blood.\n\nIV. Spend not the remnant of thy days in thoughts and fancies concerning other men, when it is not in relation to some common good, when by it thou art hindered from some other better work. That is, spend not thy time in thinking, what such a man doth, and to what end: what he saith, and what he thinks, and what he is about, and such other things or curiosities, which make a man to rove and wander from the care and observation of that part of himself, which is rational, and overruling. See therefore in the whole series and connection of thy thoughts, that thou be careful to prevent whatsoever is idle and impertinent: but especially, whatsoever is curious and malicious: and thou must use thyself to think only of such things, of which if a man upon a sudden should ask thee, what it is that thou art now thinking, thou mayest answer This, and That, freely and boldly, that so by thy thoughts it may presently appear that in all thee is sincere, and peaceable; as becometh one that is made for society, and regards not pleasures, nor gives way to any voluptuous imaginations at all: free from all contentiousness, envy, and suspicion, and from whatsoever else thou wouldest blush to confess thy thoughts were set upon. He that is such, is he surely that doth not put off to lay hold on that which is best indeed, a very priest and minister of the gods, well acquainted and in good correspondence with him especially that is seated and placed within himself, as in a temple and sacrary: to whom also he keeps and preserves himself unspotted by pleasure, undaunted by pain; free from any manner of wrong, or contumely, by himself offered unto himself: not capable of any evil from others: a wrestler of the best sort, and for the highest prize, that he may not be cast down by any passion or affection of his own; deeply dyed and drenched in righteousness, embracing and accepting with his whole heart whatsoever either happeneth or is allotted unto him. One who not often, nor without some great necessity tending to some public good, mindeth what any other, either speaks, or doth, or purposeth: for those things only that are in his own power, or that are truly his own, are the objects of his employments, and his thoughts are ever taken up with those things, which of the whole universe are by the fates or Providence destinated and appropriated unto himself. Those things that are his own, and in his own power, he himself takes order, for that they be good: and as for those that happen unto him, he believes them to be so. For that lot and portion which is assigned to every one, as it is unavoidable and necessary, so is it always profitable. He remembers besides that whatsoever partakes of reason, is akin unto him, and that to care for all men generally, is agreeing to the nature of a man: but as for honour and praise, that they ought not generally to be admitted and accepted of from all, but from such only, who live according to nature. As for them that do not, what manner of men they be at home, or abroad; day or night, how conditioned themselves with what manner of conditions, or with men of what conditions they moil and pass away the time together, he knoweth, and remembers right well, he therefore regards not such praise and approbation, as proceeding from them, who cannot like and approve themselves.\n\nV. Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor without due examination, nor with reluctancy. Affect not to set out thy thoughts with curious neat language. Be neither a great talker, nor a great undertaker. Moreover, let thy God that is in thee to rule over thee, find by thee, that he hath to do with a man; an aged man; a sociable man; a Roman; a prince; one that hath ordered his life, as one that expecteth, as it were, nothing but the sound of the trumpet, sounding a retreat to depart out of this life with all expedition. One who for his word or actions neither needs an oath, nor any man to be a witness.\n\nVI. To be cheerful, and to stand in no need, either of other men's help or attendance, or of that rest and tranquillity, which thou must be beholding to others for. Rather like one that is straight of himself, or hath ever been straight, than one that hath been rectified.\n\nVII. If thou shalt find anything in this mortal life better than righteousness, than truth, temperance, fortitude, and in general better than a mind contented both with those things which according to right and reason she doth, and in those, which without her will and knowledge happen unto thee by the providence; if I say, thou canst find out anything better than this, apply thyself unto it with thy whole heart, and that which is best wheresoever thou dost find it, enjoy freely. But if nothing thou shalt find worthy to be preferred to that spirit which is within thee; if nothing better than to subject unto thee thine own lusts and desires, and not to give way to any fancies or imaginations before thou hast duly considered of them, nothing better than to withdraw thyself (to use Socrates his words) from all sensuality, and submit thyself unto the gods, and to have care of all men in general: if thou shalt find that all other things in comparison of this, are but vile, and of little moment; then give not way to any other thing, which being once though but affected and inclined unto, it will no more be in thy power without all distraction as thou oughtest to prefer and to pursue after that good, which is thine own and thy proper good. For it is not lawful, that anything that is of another and inferior kind and nature, be it what it will, as either popular applause, or honour, or riches, or pleasures; should be suffered to confront and contest as it were, with that which is rational, and operatively good. For all these things, if once though but for a while, they begin to please, they presently prevail, and pervert a man's mind, or turn a man from the right way. Do thou therefore I say absolutely and freely make choice of that which is best, and stick unto it. Now, that they say is best, which is most profitable. If they mean profitable to man as he is a rational man, stand thou to it, and maintain it; but if they mean profitable, as he is a creature, only reject it; and from this thy tenet and conclusion keep off carefully all plausible shows and colours of external appearance, that thou mayest be able to discern things rightly.\n\nVIII. Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shall ever constrain thee either to break thy faith, or to lose thy modesty; to hate any man, to suspect, to curse, to dissemble, to lust after anything, that requireth the secret of walls or veils. But he that preferreth before all things his rational part and spirit, and the sacred mysteries of virtue which issueth from it, he shall never lament and exclaim, never sigh; he shall never want either solitude or company: and which is chiefest of all, he shall live without either desire or fear. And as for life, whether for a long or short time he shall enjoy his soul thus compassed about with a body, he is altogether indifferent. For if even now he were to depart, he is as ready for it, as for any other action, which may be performed with modesty and decency. For all his life long, this is his only care, that his mind may always be occupied in such intentions and objects, as are proper to a rational sociable creature.\n\nIX. In the mind that is once truly disciplined and purged, thou canst not find anything, either foul or impure, or as it were festered: nothing that is either servile, or affected: no partial tie; no malicious averseness; nothing obnoxious; nothing concealed. The life of such an one, death can never surprise as imperfect; as of an actor, that should die before he had ended, or the play itself were at an end, a man might speak.\n\nX. Use thine opinative faculty with all honour and respect, for in her indeed is all: that thy opinion do not beget in thy understanding anything contrary to either nature, or the proper constitution of a rational creature. The end and object of a rational constitution is, to do nothing rashly, to be kindly affected towards men, and in all things willingly to submit unto the gods. Casting therefore all other things aside, keep thyself to these few, and remember withal that no man properly can be said to live more than that which is now present, which is but a moment of time. Whatsoever is besides either is already past, or uncertain. The time therefore that any man doth live, is but a little, and the place where he liveth, is but a very little corner of the earth, and the greatest fame that can remain of a man after his death, even that is but little, and that too, such as it is whilst it is, is by the succession of silly mortal men preserved, who likewise shall shortly die, and even whiles they live know not what in very deed they themselves are: and much less can know one, who long before is dead and gone.\n\nXI. To these ever-present helps and mementoes, let one more be added, ever to make a particular description and delineation as it were of every object that presents itself to thy mind, that thou mayest wholly and throughly contemplate it, in its own proper nature, bare and naked; wholly, and severally; divided into its several parts and quarters: and then by thyself in thy mind, to call both it, and those things of which it doth consist, and in which it shall be resolved, by their own proper true names, and appellations. For there is nothing so effectual to beget true magnanimity, as to be able truly and methodically to examine and consider all things that happen in this life, and so to penetrate into their natures, that at the same time, this also may concur in our apprehensions: what is the true use of it? and what is the true nature of this universe, to which it is useful? how much in regard of the universe may it be esteemed? how much in regard of man, a citizen of the supreme city, of which all other cities in the world are as it were but houses and families?\n\nXII. What is this, that now my fancy is set upon ? of what things doth it consist? how long can it last? which of all the virtues is the proper virtue for this present use? as whether meekness, fortitude, truth, faith, sincerity, contentation, or any of the rest? Of everything therefore thou must use thyself to say, This immediately comes from God, this by that fatal connection, and concatenation of things, or (which almost comes to one) by some coincidental casualty. And as for this, it proceeds from my neighbour, my kinsman, my fellow: through his ignorance indeed, because he knows not what is truly natural unto him: but I know it, and therefore carry myself towards him according to the natural law of fellowship; that is kindly, and justly. As for those things that of themselves are altogether indifferent, as in my best judgment I conceive everything to deserve more or less, so I carry myself towards it.\n\nXIII. If thou shalt intend that which is present, following the rule of right and reason carefully, solidly, meekly, and shalt not intermix any other businesses, but shall study this only to preserve thy spirit impolluted, and pure, and shall cleave unto him without either hope or fear of anything, in all things that thou shalt either do or speak, contenting thyself with heroical truth, thou shalt live happily; and from this, there is no man that can hinder thee.\n\nXIV. As physicians and chirurgeons have always their instruments ready at hand for all sudden cures; so have thou always thy dogmata in a readiness for the knowledge of things, both divine and human: and whatsoever thou dost, even in the smallest things that thou dost, thou must ever remember that mutual relation, and connection that is between these two things divine, and things human. For without relation unto God, thou shalt never speed in any worldly actions; nor on the other side in any divine, without some respect had to things human.\n\nXV. Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral commentaries, nor the acts of the famous Romans and Grecians; nor those excerpta from several books; all which thou hadst provided and laid up for thyself against thine old age. Hasten therefore to an end, and giving over all vain hopes, help thyself in time if thou carest for thyself, as thou oughtest to do.\n\nXVI. To steal, to sow, to buy, to be at rest, to see what is to be done (which is not seen by the eyes, but by another kind of sight:) what these words mean, and how many ways to be understood, they do not understand. The body, the soul, the understanding. As the senses naturally belong to the body, and the desires and affections to the soul, so do the dogmata to the understanding.\n\nXVII. To be capable of fancies and imaginations, is common to man and beast. To be violently drawn and moved by the lusts and desires of the soul, is proper to wild beasts and monsters, such as Phalaris and Nero were. To follow reason for ordinary duties and actions is common to them also, who believe not that there be any gods, and for their advantage would make no conscience to betray their own country; and who when once the doors be shut upon them, dare do anything. If therefore all things else be common to these likewise, it follows, that for a man to like and embrace all things that happen and are destinated unto him, and not to trouble and molest that spirit which is seated in the temple of his own breast, with a multitude of vain fancies and imaginations, but to keep him propitious and to obey him as a god, never either speaking anything contrary to truth, or doing anything contrary to justice, is the only true property of a good man. And such a one, though no man should believe that he liveth as he doth, either sincerely and conscionably, or cheerful and contentedly; yet is he neither with any man at all angry for it, nor diverted by it from the way that leadeth to the end of his life, through which a man must pass pure, ever ready to depart, and willing of himself without any compulsion to fit and accommodate himself to his proper lot and portion.\n\n\n\nTHE FOURTH BOOK\n\n\nI. That inward mistress part of man if it be in its own true natural temper, is towards all worldly chances and events ever so disposed and affected, that it will easily turn and apply itself to that which may be, and is within its own power to compass, when that cannot be which at first it intended. For it never doth absolutely addict and apply itself to any one object, but whatsoever it is that it doth now intend and prosecute, it doth prosecute it with exception and reservation; so that whatsoever it is that falls out contrary to its first intentions, even that afterwards it makes its proper object. Even as the fire when it prevails upon those things that are in his way; by which things indeed a little fire would have been quenched, but a great fire doth soon turn to its own nature, and so consume whatsoever comes in his way: yea by those very things it is made greater and greater.\n\nII. Let nothing be done rashly, and at random, but all things according to the most exact and perfect rules of art.\n\nIII. They seek for themselves private retiring places, as country villages, the sea-shore, mountains; yea thou thyself art wont to long much after such places. But all this thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than to his own soul; he especially who is beforehand provided of such things within, which whensoever he doth withdraw himself to look in, may presently afford unto him perfect ease and tranquillity. By tranquillity I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, free from all confusion and tumultuousness. Afford then thyself this retiring continually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts be brief and fundamental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind, may suffice thee to purge thy soul throughly, and to send thee away well pleased with those things whatsoever they be, which now again after this short withdrawing of thy soul into herself thou dost return unto. For what is it that thou art offended at? Can it be at the wickedness of men, when thou dost call to mind this conclusion, that all reasonable creatures are made one for another? and that it is part of justice to bear with them? and that it is against their wills that they offend? and how many already, who once likewise prosecuted their enmities, suspected, hated, and fiercely contended, are now long ago stretched out, and reduced unto ashes? It is time for thee to make an end. As for those things which among the common chances of the world happen unto thee as thy particular lot and portion, canst thou be displeased with any of them, when thou dost call that our ordinary dilemma to mind, either a providence, or Democritus his atoms; and with it, whatsoever we brought to prove that the whole world is as it were one city? And as for thy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that thy mind and understanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own power, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently, or whether harshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether indifferent: and whatsoever else thou hast heard and assented unto concerning either pain or pleasure? But the care of thine honour and reputation will perchance distract thee? How can that be, if thou dost look back, and consider both how quickly all things that are, are forgotten, and what an immense chaos of eternity was before, and will follow after all things: and the vanity of praise, and the inconstancy and variableness of human judgments and opinions, and the narrowness of the place, wherein it is limited and circumscribed? For the whole earth is but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is but a very little part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of men are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou often put in practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little part of thyself; and above all things, keep thyself from distraction, and intend not anything vehemently, but be free and consider all things, as a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose true nature is to be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among other things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw thyself, let those two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that the things or objects themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand without still and quiet, and that it is from the opinion only which is within, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth proceed. The next, that all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very little while be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many changes and alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an eyewitness of in thy time. This world is mere change, and this life, opinion.\n\nIV. If to understand and to be reasonable be common unto all men, then is that reason, for which we are termed reasonable, common unto all. If reason is general, then is that reason also, which prescribeth what is to be done and what not, common unto all. If that, then law. If law, then are we fellow-citizens. If so, then are we partners in some one commonweal. If so, then the world is as it were a city. For which other commonweal is it, that all men can be said to be members of? From this common city it is, that understanding, reason, and law is derived unto us, for from whence else? For as that which in me is earthly I have from some common earth; and that which is moist from some other element is imparted; as my breath and life hath its proper fountain; and that likewise which is dry and fiery in me: (for there is nothing which doth not proceed from something; as also there is nothing that can be reduced unto mere nothing:) so also is there some common beginning from whence my understanding bath proceeded.\n\nV. As generation is, so also death, a secret of nature's wisdom: a mixture of elements, resolved into the same elements again, a thing surely which no man ought to be ashamed of: in a series of other fatal events and consequences, which a rational creature is subject unto, not improper or incongruous, nor contrary to the natural and proper constitution of man himself.\n\nVI. Such and such things, from such and such causes, must of necessity proceed. He that would not have such things to happen, is as he that would have the fig-tree grow without any sap or moisture. In sum, remember this, that within a very little while, both thou and he shall both be dead, and after a little while more, not so much as your names and memories shall be remaining.\n\nVII. Let opinion be taken away, and no man will think himself wronged. If no man shall think himself wronged, then is there no more any such thing as wrong. That which makes not man himself the worse, cannot make his life the worse, neither can it hurt him either inwardly or outwardly. It was expedient in nature that it should be so, and therefore necessary.\n\nVIII. Whatsoever doth happen in the world, doth happen justly, and so if thou dost well take heed, thou shalt find it. I say not only in right order by a series of inevitable consequences, but according to justice and as it were by way of equal distribution, according to the true worth of everything. Continue then to take notice of it, as thou hast begun, and whatsoever thou dost, do it not without this proviso, that it be a thing of that nature that a good man (as the word good is properly taken) may do it. This observe carefully in every action.\n\nIX. Conceit no such things, as he that wrongeth thee conceiveth, or would have thee to conceive, but look into the matter itself, and see what it is in very truth.\n\nX. These two rules, thou must have always in a readiness. First, do nothing at all, but what reason proceeding from that regal and supreme part, shall for the good and benefit of men, suggest unto thee. And secondly, if any man that is present shall be able to rectify thee or to turn thee from some erroneous persuasion, that thou be always ready to change thy mind, and this change to proceed, not from any respect of any pleasure or credit thereon depending, but always from some probable apparent ground of justice, or of some public good thereby to be furthered; or from some other such inducement.\n\nXI. Hast thou reason? I have. Why then makest thou not use of it? For if thy reason do her part, what more canst thou require?\n\nXII. As a part hitherto thou hast had a particular subsistence: and now shalt thou vanish away into the common substance of Him, who first begot thee, or rather thou shalt be resumed again into that original rational substance, out of which all others have issued, and are propagated. Many small pieces of frankincense are set upon the same altar, one drops first and is consumed, another after; and it comes all to one.\n\nXIII. Within ten days, if so happen, thou shalt be esteemed a god of them, who now if thou shalt return to the dogmata and to the honouring of reason, will esteem of thee no better than of a mere brute, and of an ape.\n\nXIV. Not as though thou hadst thousands of years to live. Death hangs over thee: whilst yet thou livest, whilst thou mayest, be good.\n\nXV. Now much time and leisure doth he gain, who is not curious to know what his neighbour hath said, or hath done, or hath attempted, but only what he doth himself, that it may be just and holy? or to express it in Agathos' words, Not to look about upon the evil conditions of others, but to run on straight in the line, without any loose and extravagant agitation.\n\nXVI. He who is greedy of credit and reputation after his death, doth not consider, that they themselves by whom he is remembered, shall soon after every one of them be dead; and they likewise that succeed those; until at last all memory, which hitherto by the succession of men admiring and soon after dying hath had its course, be quite extinct. But suppose that both they that shall remember thee, and thy memory with them should be immortal, what is that to thee? I will not say to thee after thou art dead; but even to thee living, what is thy praise? But only for a secret and politic consideration, which we calloikonomian or dispensation. For as for that, that it is the gift of nature, whatsoever is commended in thee, what might be objected from thence, let that now that we are upon another consideration be omitted as unseasonable. That which is fair and goodly, whatsoever it be, and in what respect soever it be, that it is fair and goodly, it is so of itself, and terminates in itself, not admitting praise as a part or member: that therefore which is praised, is not thereby made either better or worse. This I understand even of those things, that are commonly called fair and good, as those which are commended either for the matter itself, or for curious workmanship. As for that which is truly good, what can it stand in need of more than either justice or truth ; or more than either kindness and modesty? Which of all those, either becomes good or fair, because commended; or dispraised suffers any damage? Doth the emerald become worse in itself, or more vile if it be not commended? Doth gold, or ivory, or purple? Is there anything that doth though never so common, as a knife, a flower, or a tree?\n\nXVII. If so be that the souls remain after death (say they that will not believe it); how is the air from all eternity able to contain them? How is the earth (say I) ever from that time able to Contain the bodies of them that are buried? For as here the change and resolution of dead bodies into another kind of subsistence (whatsoever it be;) makes place for other dead bodies : so the souls after death transferred into the air, after they have conversed there a while, are either by way of transmutation, or transfusion, or conflagration, received again into that original rational substance, from which all others do proceed: and so give way to those souls, who before coupled and associated unto bodies, now begin to subsist single. This, upon a supposition that the souls after death do for a while subsist single, may be answered. And here, (besides the number of bodies, so buried and contained by the earth), we may further consider the number of several beasts, eaten by us men, and by other creatures. For notwithstanding that such a multitude of them is daily consumed, and as it were buried in the bodies of the eaters, yet is the same place and body able to contain them, by reason of their conversion, partly into blood, partly into air and fire. What in these things is the speculation of truth? to divide things into that which is passive and material; and that which is active and formal.\n\nXVIII. Not to wander out of the way, but upon every motion and desire, to perform that which is just: and ever to be careful to attain to the true natural apprehension of every fancy, that presents itself.\n\nXIX. Whatsoever is expedient unto thee, O World, is expedient unto me; nothing can either be 'unseasonable unto me, or out of date, which unto thee is seasonable. Whatsoever thy seasons bear, shall ever by me be esteemed as happy fruit, and increase. O Nature! from thee are all things, in thee all things subsist, and to thee all tend. Could he say of Athens, Thou lovely city of Cecrops; and shalt not thou say of the world, Thou lovely city of God?\n\nXX. They will say commonly, Meddle not with many things, if thou wilt live cheerfully. Certainly there is nothing better, than for a man to confine himself to necessary actions; to such and so many only, as reason in a creature that knows itself born for society, will command and enjoin. This will not only procure that cheerfulness, which from the goodness, but that also, which from the paucity of actions doth usually proceed. For since it is so, that most of those things, which we either speak or do, are unnecessary; if a man shall cut them off, it must needs follow that he shall thereby gain much leisure, and save much trouble, and therefore at every action a man must privately by way of admonition suggest unto himself, What? may not this that now I go about, be of the number of unnecessary actions? Neither must he use himself to cut off actions only, but thoughts and imaginations also, that are unnecessary for so will unnecessary consequent actions the better be prevented and cut off.\n\nXXI. Try also how a good man's life; (of one, who is well pleased with those things whatsoever, which among the common changes and chances of this world fall to his own lot and share; and can live well contented and fully satisfied in the justice of his own proper present action, and in the goodness of his disposition for the future:) will agree with thee. Thou hast had experience of that other kind of life : make now trial of this also. Trouble not thyself any more henceforth, reduce thyself unto perfect simplicity. Doth any man offend? It is against himself that he doth offend: why should it trouble thee? Hath anything happened unto thee ? It is well, whatsoever it be, it is that which of all the common chances of the world from the very beginning in the series of all other things that have, or shall happen, was destinated and appointed unto thee. To comprehend all in a few words, our life is short; we must endeavour to gain the present time with best discretion and justice. Use recreation with sobriety.\n\nXXII. Either this world is a kosmoz or comely piece, because all disposed and governed by certain order: or if it be a mixture, though confused, yet still it is a comely piece. For is it possible that in thee there should be any beauty at all, and that in the whole world there should be nothing but disorder and confusion? and all things in it too, by natural different properties one from another differenced and distinguished; and yet all through diffused, and by natural sympathy, one to another united, as they are?\n\nXXIII. A black or malign disposition, an effeminate disposition; an hard inexorable disposition, a wild inhuman disposition, a sheepish disposition, a childish disposition; a blockish, a false, a scurril, a fraudulent, a tyrannical: what then? If he be a stranger in the world, that knows not the things that are in it; why not he a stranger as well, that wonders at the things that are done in it?\n\nXXIV. He is a true fugitive, that flies from reason, by which men are sociable. He blind, who cannot see with the eyes of his understanding. He poor, that stands in need of another, and hath not in himself all things needful for this life. He an aposteme of the world, who by being discontented with those things that happen unto him in the world, doth as it were apostatise, and separate himself from common nature's rational administration. For the same nature it is that brings this unto thee, whatsoever it be, that first brought thee into the world. He raises sedition in the city, who by irrational actions withdraws his own soul from that one and common soul of all rational creatures.\n\nXXV. There is, who without so much as a coat; and there is, who without so much as a book, doth put philosophy in practice. I am half naked, neither have I bread to eat, and yet I depart not from reason, saith one. But I say; I want the food of good teaching, and instructions, and yet I depart not from reason.\n\nXXVI. What art and profession soever thou hast learned, endeavour to affect it, and comfort thyself in it; and pass the remainder of thy life as one who from his whole heart commits himself and whatsoever belongs unto him, unto the gods: and as for men, carry not thyself either tyrannically or servilely towards any.\n\nXXVII. Consider in my mind, for example's sake, the times of Vespasian: thou shalt see but the same things: some marrying, some bringing up children, some sick, some dying, some fighting, some feasting, some merchandising, some tilling, some flattering, some boasting, some suspecting, some undermining, some wishing to die, some fretting and murmuring at their present estate, some wooing, some hoarding, some seeking after magistracies, and some after kingdoms. And is not that their age quite over, and ended? Again, consider now the times of Trajan. There likewise thou seest the very self-same things, and that age also is now over and ended. In the like manner consider other periods, both of times and of whole nations, and see how many men, after they had with all their might and main intended and prosecuted some one worldly thing or other did soon after drop away, and were resolved into the elements. But especially thou must call to mind them, whom thou thyself in thy lifetime hast known much distracted about vain things, and in the meantime neglecting to do that, and closely and unseparably (as fully satisfied with it) to adhere unto it, which their own proper constitution did require. And here thou must remember, that thy carriage in every business must be according to the worth and due proportion of it, for so shalt thou not easily be tired out and vexed, if thou shalt not dwell upon small matters longer than is fitting.\n\nXXVIII. Those words which once were common and ordinary, are now become obscure and obsolete; and so the names of men once commonly known and famous, are now become in a manner obscure and obsolete names. Camillus, Cieso, Volesius, Leonnatus; not long after, Scipio, Cato, then Augustus, then Adrianus, then Antoninus Pius: all these in a short time will be out of date, and, as things of another world as it were, become fabulous. And this I say of them, who once shined as the wonders of their ages, for as for the rest, no sooner are they expired, than with them all their fame and memory. And what is it then that shall always be remembered? all is vanity. What is it that we must bestow our care and diligence upon? even upon this only: that our minds and wills be just; that our actions be charitable; that our speech be never deceitful, or that our understanding be not subject to error; that our inclination be always set to embrace whatsoever shall happen unto us, as necessary, as usual, as ordinary, as flowing from such a beginning, and such a fountain, from which both thou thyself and all things are. Willingly therefore, and wholly surrender up thyself unto that fatal concatenation, yielding up thyself unto the fates, to be disposed of at their pleasure.\n\nXXIX. Whatsoever is now present, and from day to day hath its existence; all objects of memories, and the minds and memories themselves, incessantly consider, all things that are, have their being by change and alteration. Use thyself therefore often to meditate upon this, that the nature of the universe delights in nothing more, than in altering those things that are, and in making others like unto them. So that we may say, that whatsoever is, is but as it were the seed of that which shall be. For if thou think that that only is seed, which either the earth or the womb receiveth, thou art very simple.\n\nXXX. Thou art now ready to die, and yet hast thou not attained to that perfect simplicity: thou art yet subject to many troubles and perturbations; not yet free from all fear and suspicion of external accidents; nor yet either so meekly disposed towards all men, as thou shouldest; or so affected as one, whose only study and only wisdom is, to be just in all his actions.\n\nXXXI. Behold and observe, what is the state of their rational part; and those that the world doth account wise, see what things they fly and are afraid of; and what things they hunt after.\n\nXXXII. In another man's mind and understanding thy evil Cannot subsist, nor in any proper temper or distemper of the natural constitution of thy body, which is but as it were the coat or cottage of thy soul. Wherein then, but in that part of thee, wherein the conceit, and apprehension of any misery can subsist? Let not that part therefore admit any such conceit, and then all is well. Though thy body which is so near it should either be cut or burnt, or suffer any corruption or putrefaction, yet let that part to which it belongs to judge of these, be still at rest; that is, let her judge this, that whatsoever it is, that equally may happen to a wicked man, and to a good man, is neither good nor evil. For that which happens equally to him that lives according to nature, and to him that doth not, is neither according to nature, nor against it; and by consequent, neither good nor bad.\n\nXXXIII. Ever consider and think upon the world as being but one living substance, and having but one soul, and how all things in the world, are terminated into one sensitive power; and are done by one general motion as it were, and deliberation of that one soul; and how all things that are, concur in the cause of one another's being, and by what manner of connection and concatenation all things happen.\n\nXXXIV. What art thou, that better and divine part excepted, but as Epictetus said well, a wretched soul, appointed to carry a carcass up and down?\n\nXXXV. To suffer change can be no hurt; as no benefit it is, by change to attain to being. The age and time of the world is as it were a flood and swift current, consisting of the things that are brought to pass in the world. For as soon as anything hath appeared, and is passed away, another succeeds, and that also will presently out of sight.\n\nXXXVI. Whatsoever doth happen in the world, is, in the course of nature, as usual and ordinary as a rose in the spring, and fruit in summer. Of the same nature is sickness and death; slander, and lying in wait, and whatsoever else ordinarily doth unto fools use to be occasion either of joy or sorrow. That, whatsoever it is, that comes after, doth always very naturally, and as it were familiarly, follow upon that which was before. For thou must consider the things of the world, not as a loose independent number, consisting merely of necessary events; but as a discreet connection of things orderly and harmoniously disposed. There is then to be seen in the things of the world, not a bare succession, but an admirable correspondence and affinity.\n\nXXXVII. Let that of Heraclitus never be out of thy mind, that the death of earth, is water, and the death of water, is air; and the death of air, is fire; and so on the contrary. Remember him also who was ignorant whither the way did lead, and how that reason being the thing by which all things in the world are administered, and which men are continually and most inwardly conversant with: yet is the thing, which ordinarily they are most in opposition with, and how those things which daily happen among them, cease not daily to be strange unto them, and that we should not either speak, or do anything as men in their sleep, by opinion and bare imagination: for then we think we speak and do, and that we must not be as children, who follow their father's example; for best reason alleging their bare successive tradition from our forefathers we have received it.\n\nXXXVIII. Even as if any of the gods should tell thee, Thou shalt certainly die to-morrow, or next day, thou wouldst not, except thou wert extremely base and pusillanimous, take it for a great benefit, rather to die the next day after, than to-morrow; (for alas, what is the difference!) so, for the same reason, think it no great matter to die rather many years after, than the very next day.\n\nXXXIX. Let it be thy perpetual meditation, how many physicians who once looked so grim, and so tetrically shrunk their brows upon their patients, are dead and gone themselves. How many astrologers, after that in great ostentation they had foretold the death of some others, how many philosophers after so many elaborate tracts and volumes concerning either mortality or immortality; how many brave captains and commanders, after the death and slaughter of so many; how many kings and tyrants, after they had with such horror and insolency abused their power upon men's lives, as though themselves had been immortal; how many, that I may so speak, whole cities both men and towns: Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and others innumerable are dead and gone. Run them over also, whom thou thyself, one after another, hast known in thy time to drop away. Such and such a one took care of such and such a one's burial, and soon after was buried himself. So one, so another: and all things in a short time. For herein lieth all indeed, ever to look upon all worldly things, as things for their continuance, that are but for a day: and for their worth, most vile, and contemptible, as for example, What is man? That which but the other day when he was conceived was vile snivel; and within few days shall be either an embalmed carcass, or mere ashes. Thus must thou according to truth and nature, throughly consider how man's life is but for a very moment of time, and so depart meek and contented: even as if a ripe olive falling should praise the ground that bare her, and give thanks to the tree that begat her.\n\nXL. Thou must be like a promontory of the sea, against which though the waves beat continually, yet it both itself stands, and about it are those swelling waves stilled and quieted.\n\nXLI. Oh, wretched I, to whom this mischance is happened! nay, happy I, to whom this thing being happened, I can continue without grief; neither wounded by that which is present, nor in fear of that which is to come. For as for this, it might have happened unto any man, but any man having such a thing befallen him, could not have continued without grief. Why then should that rather be an unhappiness, than this a happiness? But however, canst thou, O man! term that unhappiness, which is no mischance to the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the nature of man, which is not contrary to the end and will of his nature? What then hast thou learned is the will of man's nature? Doth that then which hath happened unto thee, hinder thee from being just? or magnanimous? or temperate? or wise? or circumspect? or true? or modest? or free? or from anything else of all those things in the present enjoying and possession whereof the nature of man, (as then enjoying all that is proper unto her,) is fully satisfied? Now to conclude; upon all occasion of sorrow remember henceforth to make use of this dogma, that whatsoever it is that hath happened unto thee, is in very deed no such thing of itself, as a misfortune; but that to bear it generously, is certainly great happiness.\n\nXLII. It is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a good effectual remedy against the fear of death, for a man to consider in his mind the examples of such, who greedily and covetously (as it were) did for a long time enjoy their lives. What have they got more, than they whose deaths have been untimely? Are not they themselves dead at the last? as Cadiciant's, Fabius, Julianus Lepidus, or any other who in their lifetime having buried many, were at the last buried themselves. The whole space of any man's life, is but little; and as little as it is, with what troubles, with what manner of dispositions, and in the society of how wretched a body must it be passed! Let it be therefore unto thee altogether as a matter of indifferency. For if thou shalt look backward; behold, what an infinite chaos of time doth present itself unto thee; and as infinite a chaos, if thou shalt look forward. In that which is so infinite, what difference can there be between that which liveth but three days, and that which liveth three ages?\n\nXLIII. Let thy course ever be the most compendious way. The most compendious, is that which is according to nature: that is, in all both words and deeds, ever to follow that which is most sound and perfect. For such a resolution will free a man from all trouble, strife, dissembling, and ostentation\n\n\n\nTHE FIFTH BOOK\n\n\nI. In the morning when thou findest thyself unwilling to rise, consider with thyself presently, it is to go about a man's work that I am stirred up. Am I then yet unwilling to go about that, for which I myself was born and brought forth into this world? Or was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much of myself in a warm bed? 'O but this is pleasing.' And was it then for this that thou wert born, that thou mightest enjoy pleasure? Was it not in very truth for this, that thou mightest always be busy and in action? Seest thou not how all things in the world besides, how every tree md plant, how sparrows and ants, spiders and bees: how all in their kind are intent as it were orderly to perform whatsoever (towards the preservation of this orderly universe) naturally doth become and belong unto thin? And wilt not thou do that, which belongs unto a man to do? Wilt not thou run to do that, which thy nature doth require? 'But thou must have some rest.' Yes, thou must. Nature hath of that also, as well as of eating and drinking, allowed thee a certain stint. But thou guest beyond thy stint, and beyond that which would suffice, and in matter of action, there thou comest short of that which thou mayest. It must needs be therefore, that thou dost not love thyself, for if thou didst, thou wouldst also love thy nature, and that which thy nature doth propose unto herself as her end. Others, as many as take pleasure in their trade and profession, can even pine themselves at their works, and neglect their bodies and their food for it; and doest thou less honour thy nature, than an ordinary mechanic his trade; or a good dancer his art? than a covetous man his silver, and vainglorious man applause? These to whatsoever they take an affection, can be content to want their meat and sleep, to further that every one which he affects: and shall actions tending to the common good of human society, seem more vile unto thee, or worthy of less respect and intention?\n\nII. How easy a thing is it for a man to put off from him all turbulent adventitious imaginations, and presently to be in perfect rest and tranquillity!\n\nIII. Think thyself fit and worthy to speak, or to do anything that is according to nature, and let not the reproach, or report of some that may ensue upon it, ever deter thee. If it be right and honest to be spoken or done, undervalue not thyself so much, as to be discouraged from it. As for them, they have their own rational over-ruling part, and their own proper inclination: which thou must not stand and look about to take notice of, but go on straight, whither both thine own particular, and the common nature do lead thee; and the way of both these, is but one.\n\nIV. I continue my course by actions according to nature, until I fall and cease, breathing out my last breath into that air, by which continually breathed in I did live; and falling upon that earth, out of whose gifts and fruits my father gathered his seed, my mother her blood, and my nurse her milk, out of which for so many years I have been provided, both of meat and drink. And lastly, which beareth me that tread upon it, and beareth with me that so many ways do abuse it, or so freely make use of it, so many ways to so many ends.\n\nV. No man can admire thee for thy sharp acute language, such is thy natural disability that way. Be it so: yet there be many other good things, for the want of which thou canst not plead the want or natural ability. Let them be seen in thee, which depend wholly from thee; sincerity, gravity, laboriousness, contempt of pleasures; be not querulous, be Content with little, be kind, be free; avoid all superfluity, all vain prattling; be magnanimous. Doest not thou perceive, how many things there be, which notwithstanding any pretence of natural indisposition and unfitness, thou mightest have performed and exhibited, and yet still thou doest voluntarily continue drooping downwards? Or wilt thou say. that it is through defect of thy natural constitution, that thou art constrained to murmur, to be base and wretched to flatter; now to accuse, and now to please, and pacify thy body: to be vainglorious, to be so giddy-headed., and unsettled in thy thoughts? nay (witnesses be the Gods) of all these thou mightest have been rid long ago: only, this thou must have been contented with, to have borne the blame of one that is somewhat slow and dull. wherein thou must so exercise thyself, as one who neither doth much take to heart this his natural defect, nor yet pleaseth himself in it.\n\nVi. Such there be, who when they have done a good turn to any, are ready to set them on the score for it, and to require retaliation. Others there be, who though they stand not upon retaliation, to require any, yet they think with themselves nevertheless, that such a one is their debtor, and they know as their word is what they have done. Others again there be, who when they have done any such thing, do not so much as know what they have done; but are like unto the vine, which beareth her grapes, and when once she hath borne her own proper fruit, is contented and seeks for no further recompense. As a horse after a race, and a hunting dog when he hath hunted, and a bee when she hath made her honey, look not for applause and commendation; so neither doth that man that rightly doth understand his own nature when he hath done a good turn: but from one doth proceed to do another, even as the vine after she hath once borne fruit in her own proper season, is ready for another time. Thou therefore must be one of them, who what they do, barely do it without any further thought, and are in a manner insensible of what they do. 'Nay but,' will some reply perchance, 'this very thing a rational man is bound unto, to understand what it is, that he doeth.' For it is the property, say they, of one that is naturally sociable, to be sensible, that he doth operate sociably: nay, and to desire, that the party him self that is sociably dealt with, should be sensible of it too. I answer, That which thou sayest is true indeed, but the true meaning of that which is said, thou dost not understand. And therefore art thou one of those first, whom I mentioned. For they also are led by a probable appearance of reason. But if thou dost desire to understand truly what it is that is said, fear not that thou shalt therefore give over any sociable action.\n\nVII. The form of the Athenians' prayer did run thus: 'O rain, rain, good Jupiter, upon all the grounds and fields that belong to the Athenians.' Either we should not pray at all, or thus absolutely and freely; and not every one for himself in particular alone.\n\nVIII. As we say commonly, The physician hath prescribed unto this man, riding; unto another, cold baths; unto a third, to go barefoot: so it is alike to say, The nature of the universe hath prescribed unto this man sickness, or blindness, or some loss, or damage or some such thing. For as there, when we say of a physician, that he hath prescribed anything, our meaning is, that he hath appointed this for that, as subordinate and conducing to health: so here, whatsoever doth happen unto any, is ordained unto him as a thing subordinate unto the fates, and therefore do we say of such things, that they do happen, or fall together; as of square stones, when either in walls, or pyramids in a certain position they fit one another, and agree as it were in an harmony, the masons say, that they do (συμβαίνειν) as if thou shouldest say, fall together: so that in the general, though the things be divers that make it, yet the consent or harmony itself is but one. And as the whole world is made up of all the particular bodies of the world, one perfect and complete body, of the same nature that particular bodies; so is the destiny of particular causes and events one general one, of the same nature that particular causes are. What I now say, even they that are mere idiots are not ignorant of: for they say commonly (τοῦτο ἔφερεν ἀυτῷ) that is, This his destiny hath brought upon him. This therefore is by the fates properly and particularly brought upon this, as that unto this in particular is by the physician prescribed. These therefore let us accept of in like manner, as we do those that are prescribed unto us our physicians. For them also in themselves shall We find to contain many harsh things, but we nevertheless, in hope of health, and recovery, accept of them. Let. the fulfilling' and accomplishment of those things which the common nature bath determined, be unto thee as thy health. Accept then, and be pleased with whatsoever doth happen, though otherwise harsh and unpleasing, as tending to that end, to the health and welfare of the universe, and to Jove's happiness and prosperity. For this whatsoever it be, should not have been produced, had it not conduced to the good of the universe. For neither doth any ordinary particular nature bring anything to pass, that is not to whatsoever is within the sphere of its own proper administration and government agreeable and subordinate. For these two considerations then thou must be well pleased with anything that doth happen unto thee. First, because that for thee properly it was brought to pass, and unto thee it was prescribed; and that from the very beginning by the series and connection of the first causes, it hath ever had a reference unto thee. And secondly, because the good success and perfect welfare, and indeed the very continuance of Him, that is the Administrator of the whole, doth in a manner depend on it. For the whole (because whole, therefore entire and perfect) is maimed, and mutilated, if thou shalt cut off anything at all, whereby the coherence, and contiguity as of parts, so of causes, is maintained and preserved. Of which certain it is, that thou doest (as much as lieth in thee) cut off, and in some sort violently take somewhat away, as often as thou art displeased with anything that happeneth.\n\nIX. Be not discontented, be not disheartened, be not out of hope, if often it succeed not so well with thee punctually and precisely to do all things according to the right dogmata, but being once cast off, return unto them again: and as for those many and more frequent occurrences, either of worldly distractions, or human infirmities, which as a man thou canst not but in some measure be subject unto, be not thou discontented with them; but however, love and affect that only which thou dust return unto: a philosopher's life, and proper occupation after the most exact manner. And when thou dust return to thy philosophy, return not unto it as the manner of some is, after play and liberty as it were, to their schoolmasters and pedagogues; but as they that have sore eyes to their sponge and egg: or as another to his cataplasm; or as others to their fomentations: so shalt not thou make it a matter of ostentation at all to obey reason but of ease and comfort. And remember that philosophy requireth nothing of thee, but what thy nature requireth, and wouldest thou thyself desire anything that is not according to nature? for which of these sayest thou; that which is according to nature or against it, is of itself more kind and pleasing? Is it not for that respect especially, that pleasure itself is to so many men's hurt and overthrow, most prevalent, because esteemed commonly most kind, and natural? But consider well whether magnanimity rather, and true liberty, and true simplicity, and equanimity, and holiness; whether these be not most kind and natural? And prudency itself, what more kind and amiable than it, when thou shalt truly consider with thyself, what it is through all the proper objects of thy rational intellectual faculty currently to go on without any fall or stumble? As for the things of the world, their true nature is in a manner so involved with obscurity, that unto many philosophers, and those no mean ones, they seemed altogether incomprehensible. and the Stoics themselves, though they judge them not altogether incomprehensible, yet scarce and not without much difficulty, comprehensible, so that all assent of ours is fallible, for who is he that is infallible in his conclusions? >From the nature of things, pass now unto their subjects and matter: how temporary, how vile are they I such as may be in the power and possession of some abominable loose liver, of some common strumpet, of some notorious oppressor and extortioner. Pass from thence to the dispositions of them that thou doest ordinarily converse with, how hardly do we bear, even with the most loving and amiable! that I may not say, how hard it is for us to bear even with our own selves, in such obscurity, and impurity of things: in such and so continual a flux both of the substances and time; both of the motions themselves, and things moved; what it is that we can fasten upon; either to honour, and respect especially; or seriously, and studiously to seek after; I cannot so much as conceive For indeed they are things contrary.\n\nX. Thou must comfort thyself in the expectation of thy natural dissolution, and in the meantime not grieve at the delay; but rest contented in those two things. First, that nothing shall happen unto thee, which is not according to the nature of the universe. Secondly, that it is in thy power, to do nothing against thine own proper God, and inward spirit. For it is not in any man's power to constrain thee to transgress against him.\n\nXI. What is the use that now at this present I make of my soul? Thus from time to time and upon all occasions thou must put this question to thyself; what is now that part of mine which they call the rational mistress part, employed about? Whose soul do I now properly possess? a child's? or a youth's? a woman's? or a tyrant's? some brute, or some wild beast's soul?\n\nXII. What those things are in themselves, which by the greatest part are esteemed good, thou mayest gather even from this. For if a man shall hear things mentioned as good, which are really good indeed, such as are prudence, temperance, justice, fortitude, after so much heard and conceived, he cannot endure to hear of any more, for the word good is properly spoken of them. But as for those which by the vulgar are esteemed good, if he shall hear them mentioned as good, he doth hearken for more. He is well contented to hear, that what is spoken by the comedian, is but familiarly and popularly spoken, so that even the vulgar apprehend the difference. For why is it else, that this offends not and needs not to be excused, when virtues are styled good: but that which is spoken in commendation of wealth, pleasure, or honour, we entertain it only as merrily and pleasantly spoken? Proceed therefore, and inquire further, whether it may not be that those things also which being mentioned upon the stage were merrily, and with great applause of the multitude, scoffed at with this jest, that they that possessed them had not in all the world of their own, (such was their affluence and plenty) so much as a place where to avoid their excrements. Whether, I say, those ought not also in very deed to be much respected, and esteemed of, as the only things that are truly good.\n\nXIII. All that I consist of, is either form or matter. No corruption can reduce either of these unto nothing: for neither did I of nothing become a subsistent creature. Every part of mine then. will by mutation be disposed into a certain part of the whole world, and that in time into another part; and so in infinitum; by which kind of mutation, I also became what I am, and so did they that begot me, and they before them, and so upwards in infinitum. For so we may be allowed to speak, though the age and government of the world, be to some certain periods of time limited, and confined.\n\nXIV. Reason, and rational power, are faculties which content themselves with themselves, and their own proper operations. And as for their first inclination and motion, that they take from themselves. But their progress is right to the end and object, which is in their way, as it were, and lieth just before them: that is, which is feasible and possible, whether it be that which at the first they proposed to themselves, or no. For which reason also such actions are termed katorqwseiz to intimate the directness of the way, by which they are achieved. Nothing must be thought to belong to a man, which doth not belong unto him as he is a man. These, the event of purposes, are not things required in a man. The nature of man doth not profess any such things. The final ends and consummations of actions are nothing at all to a man's nature. The end therefore of a man, or the summum bonum whereby that end is fulfilled, cannot consist in the consummation of actions purposed and intended. Again, concerning these outward worldly things, were it so that any of them did properly belong unto man, then would it not belong unto man, to condemn them and to stand in opposition with them. Neither would he be praiseworthy that can live without them; or he good, (if these were good indeed) who of his own accord doth deprive himself of any of them. But we see contrariwise, that the more a man doth withdraw himself from these wherein external pomp and greatness doth consist, or any other like these; or the better he doth bear with the loss of these, the better he is accounted.\n\nXV. Such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are, such will thy mind be in time. For the soul doth as it were receive its tincture from the fancies, and imaginations. Dye it therefore and thoroughly soak it with the assiduity of these cogitations. As for example. Wheresoever thou mayest live, there it is in thy power to live well and happy. But thou mayest live at the Court, there then also mayest thou live well and happy. Again, that which everything is made for, he is also made unto that, and cannot but naturally incline unto it. That which anything doth naturally incline unto, therein is his end. Wherein the end of everything doth consist, therein also doth his good and benefit consist. Society therefore is the proper good of a rational creature. For that we are made for society, it hath long since been demonstrated. Or can any man make any question of this, that whatsoever is naturally worse and inferior, is ordinarily subordinated to that which is better? and that those things that are best, are made one for another? And those things that have souls, are better than those that have none? and of those that have, those best that have rational souls?\n\nXVI. To desire things impossible is the part of a mad man. But it is a thing impossible, that wicked man should not commit some such things. Neither doth anything happen to any man, which in the ordinary course of nature as natural unto him doth not happen. Again, the same things happen unto others also. And truly, if either he that is ignorant that such a thing hath happened unto him, or he that is ambitious to be commended for his magnanimity, can be patient, and is not grieved: is it not a grievous thing, that either ignorance, or a vain desire to please and to be commended, should be more powerful and effectual than true prudence? As for the things themselves, they touch not the soul, neither can they have any access unto it: neither can they of themselves any ways either affect it, or move it. For she herself alone can affect and move herself, and according as the dogmata and opinions are, which she doth vouchsafe herself; so are those things which, as accessories, have any co-existence with her.\n\nXVII. After one consideration, man is nearest unto us; as we are bound to do them good, and to bear with them. But as he may oppose any of our true proper actions, so man is unto me but as a thing indifferent: even as the sun, or the wind, or some wild beast. By some of these it may be, that some operation or other of mine, may be hindered; however, of my mind and resolution itself, there can be no let or impediment, by reason of that ordinary constant both exception (or reservation wherewith it inclineth) and ready conversion of objects; from that which may not be, to that which may be, which in the prosecution of its inclinations, as occasion serves, it doth observe. For by these the mind doth turn and convert any impediment whatsoever, to be her aim and purpose. So that what before was the impediment, is now the principal object of her working; and that whihch before was in her way, is now her readiest way.\n\nXVIII. Honour that which is chiefest and most powerful in the world, and that is it, which makes use of all things, and governs all things. So also in thyself; honour that which is chiefest, and most powerful; and is of one kind and nature with that which we now spake of. For it is the very same, which being in thee, turneth all other things to its own use, and by whom also thy life is governed.\n\nXIX. That which doth not hurt the city itself; cannot hurt any citizen. This rule thou must remember to apply and make use of upon every conceit and apprehension of wrong. If the whole city be not hurt by this, neither am I certainly. And if the whole be not, why should I make it my private grievance? consider rather what it is wherein he is overseen that is thought to have done the wrong. Again, often meditate how swiftly all things that subsist, and all things that are done in the world, are carried away, and as it were conveyed out of sight: for both the substance themselves, we see as a flood, are in a continual flux; and all actions in a perpetual change; and the causes themselves, subject to a thousand alterations, neither is there anything almost, that may ever be said to be now settled and constant. Next unto this, and which follows upon it, consider both the infiniteness of the time already past, and the immense vastness of that which is to come, wherein all things are to be resolved and annihilated. Art not thou then a very fool, who for these things, art either puffed up with pride, or distracted with cares, or canst find in thy heart to make such moans as for a thing that would trouble thee for a very long time? Consider the whole universe whereof thou art but a very little part, and the whole age of the world together, whereof but a short and very momentary portion is allotted unto thee, and all the fates and destinies together, of which how much is it that comes to thy part and share! Again: another doth trespass against me. Let him look to that. He is master of his own disposition, and of his own operation. I for my part am in the meantime in possession of as much, as the common nature would have me to possess: and that which mine own nature would have me do, I do.\n\nXX. Let not that chief commanding part of thy soul be ever subject to any variation through any corporal either pain or pleasure, neither suffer it to be mixed with these, but let it both circumscribe itself, and confine those affections to their own proper parts and members. But if at any time they do reflect and rebound upon the mind and understanding (as in an united and compacted body it must needs;) then must thou not go about to resist sense and feeling, it being natural. However let not thy understanding to this natural sense and feeling, which whether unto our flesh pleasant or painful, is unto us nothing properly, add an opinion of either good or bad and all is well.\n\nXXI. To live with the Gods. He liveth with the Gods, who at all times affords unto them the spectacle of a soul, both contented and well pleased with whatsoever is afforded, or allotted unto her; and performing whatsoever is pleasing to that Spirit, whom (being part of himself) Jove hath appointed to every man as his overseer and governor.\n\nXXII. Be not angry neither with him whose breath, neither with him whose arm holes, are offensive. What can he do? such is his breath naturally, and such are his arm holes; and from such, such an effect, and such a smell must of necessity proceed. 'O, but the man (sayest thou) hath understanding in him, and might of himself know, that he by standing near, cannot choose but offend.' And thou also (God bless thee!) hast understanding. Let thy reasonable faculty, work upon his reasonable faculty; show him his fault, admonish him. If he hearken unto thee, thou hast cured him, and there will be no more occasion of anger.\n\nXXIII. 'Where there shall neither roarer be, nor harlot.' Why so? As thou dost purpose to live, when thou hast retired thyself to some such place, where neither roarer nor harlot is: so mayest thou here. And if they will not suffer thee, then mayest thou leave thy life rather than thy calling, but so as one that doth not think himself anyways wronged. Only as one would say, Here is a smoke; I will out of it. And what a great matter is this! Now till some such thing force me out, I will continue free; neither shall any man hinder me to do what I will, and my will shall ever be by the proper nature of a reasonable and sociable creature, regulated and directed.\n\nXXIV. That rational essence by which the universe is governed, is for community and society; and therefore hath it both made the things that are worse, for the best, and hath allied and knit together those which are best, as it were in an harmony. Seest thou not how it hath sub-ordinated, and co-ordinated? and how it hath distributed unto everything according to its worth? and those which have the pre-eminency and superiority above all, hath it united together, into a mutual consent and agreement.\n\nXXV. How hast thou carried thyself hitherto towards the Gods? towards thy parents? towards thy brethren? towards thy wife? towards thy children? towards thy masters? thy foster-fathers? thy friends? thy domestics? thy servants? Is it so with thee, that hitherto thou hast neither by word or deed wronged any of them? Remember withal through how many things thou hast already passed, and how many thou hast been able to endure; so that now the legend of thy life is full, and thy charge is accomplished. Again, how many truly good things have certainly by thee been discerned? how many pleasures, how many pains hast thou passed over with contempt? how many things eternally glorious hast thou despised? towards how many perverse unreasonable men hast thou carried thyself kindly, and discreetly?\n\nXXVI. Why should imprudent unlearned souls trouble that which is both learned, and prudent? And which is that that is so? she that understandeth the beginning and the end, and hath the true knowledge of that rational essence, that passeth through all things subsisting, and through all ages being ever the same, disposing and dispensing as it were this universe by certain periods of time.\n\nXXVII. Within a very little while, thou wilt be either ashes, or a sceletum; and a name perchance; and perchance, not so much as a name. And what is that but an empty sound, and a rebounding echo? Those things which in this life are dearest unto us, and of most account, they are in themselves but vain, putrid, contemptible. The most weighty and serious, if rightly esteemed, but as puppies, biting one another: or untoward children, now laughing and then crying. As for faith, and modesty, and justice, and truth, they long since, as one of the poets hath it, have abandoned this spacious earth, and retired themselves unto heaven. What is it then that doth keep thee here, if things sensible be so mutable and unsettled? and the senses so obscure, and so fallible? and our souls nothing but an exhalation of blood? and to be in credit among such, be but vanity? What is it that thou dost stay for? an extinction, or a translation; either of them with a propitious and contented mind. But still that time come, what will content thee? what else, but to worship and praise the Gods; and to do good unto men. To bear with them, and to forbear to do them any wrong. And for all external things belonging either to this thy wretched body, or life, to remember that they are neither thine, nor in thy power.\n\nXXVIII. Thou mayest always speed, if thou wilt but make choice of the right way; if in the course both of thine opinions and actions, thou wilt observe a true method. These two things be common to the souls, as of God, so of men, and of every reasonable creature, first that in their own proper work they cannot be hindered by anything: and secondly, that their happiness doth consist in a disposition to, and in the practice of righteousness; and that in these their desire is terminated.\n\nXXIX. If this neither be my wicked act, nor an act anyways depending from any wickedness of mine, and that by it the public is not hurt; what doth it concern me? And wherein can the public be hurt? For thou must not altogether be carried by conceit and common opinion: as for help thou must afford that unto them after thy best ability, and as occasion shall require, though they sustain damage, but in these middle or worldly things; but however do not thou conceive that they are truly hurt thereby: for that is not right. But as that old foster-father in the comedy, being now to take his leave doth with a great deal of ceremony, require his foster-child's rhombus, or rattle-top, remembering nevertheless that it is but a rhombus; so here also do thou likewise. For indeed what is all this pleading and public bawling for at the courts? O man, hast thou forgotten what those things are! yea but they are things that others much care for, and highly esteem of. Wilt thou therefore be a fool too ? Once I was ; let that suffice.\n\nXXX. Let death surprise rue when it will, and where it will, I may be a happy man, nevertheless. For he is a happy man, who in his lifetime dealeth unto himself a happy lot and portion. A happy lot and portion is, good inclinations of the soul, good desires, good actions.\n\n\n\nTHE SIXTH BOOK\n\n\nI. The matter itself, of which the universe doth consist, is of itself very tractable and pliable. That rational essence that doth govern it, bath in itself no cause to do evil. It bath no evil in itsell; neither can it do anything that is evil: neither can anything be hurt by it. And all things are done and determined according to its will and prescript.\n\nII. Be it all one unto thee, whether half frozen or well warm; whether only slumbering, or after a full sleep; whether discommended or commended thou do thy duty: or whether dying or doing somewhat else; for that also 'to die,' must among the rest be reckoned as one of the duties and actions of our lives.\n\nIII. Look in, let not either the proper quality, or the true worth of anything pass thee, before thou hast fully apprehended it.\n\nIV. All substances come soon to their change, and either they shall be resolved by way of exhalation (if so be that all things shall be reunited into one substance), or as others maintain, they shall be scattered and dispersed. As for that Rational Essence by which all things are governed, as it best understandeth itself, both its own disposition, and what it doth, and what matter it hath to do with and accordingly doth all things; so we that do not, no wonder, if we wonder at many things, the reasons whereof we cannot comprehend.\n\nV. The best kind of revenge is, not to become like unto them.\n\nVI. Let this be thy only joy, and thy only comfort, from one sociable kind action without intermission to pass unto another, God being ever in thy mind.\n\nVII. The rational commanding part, as it alone can stir up and turn itself; so it maketh both itself to be, and everything that happeneth, to appear unto itself, as it will itself.\n\nVIII. According to the nature of the universe all things particular are determined, not according to any other nature, either about compassing and containing; or within, dispersed and contained; or without, depending. Either this universe is a mere confused mass, and an intricate context of things, which shall in time be scattered and dispersed again: or it is an union consisting of order, and administered by Providence. If the first, why should I desire to continue any longer in this fortuit confusion and commixtion? or why should I take care for anything else, but that as soon as may be I may be earth again? And why should I trouble myself any more whilst I seek to please the Gods? Whatsoever I do, dispersion is my end, and will come upon me whether I will or no. But if the latter be, then am not I religious in vain; then will I be quiet and patient, and put my trust in Him, who is the Governor of all.\n\nIX. Whensoever by some present hard occurrences thou art constrained to be in some sort troubled and vexed, return unto thyself as soon as may be, and be not out of tune longer than thou must needs. For so shalt thou be the better able to keep thy part another time, and to maintain the harmony, if thou dost use thyself to this continually; once out, presently to have recourse unto it, and to begin again.\n\nX. If it were that thou hadst at one time both a stepmother, and a natural mother living, thou wouldst honour and respect her also; nevertheless to thine own natural mother would thy refuge, and recourse be continually. So let the court and thy philosophy be unto thee. Have recourse unto it often, and comfort thyself in her, by whom it is that those other things are made tolerable unto thee, and thou also in those things not intolerable unto others.\n\nXI. How marvellous useful it is for a man to represent unto himself meats, and all such things that are for the mouth, under a right apprehension and imagination! as for example: This is the carcass of a fish; this of a bird; and this of a hog. And again more generally; This phalernum, this excellent highly commended wine, is but the bare juice of an ordinary grape. This purple robe, but sheep's hairs, dyed with the blood of a shellfish. So for coitus, it is but the attrition of an ordinary base entrail, and the excretion of a little vile snivel, with a certain kind of convulsion: according to Hippocrates his opinion. How excellent useful are these lively fancies and representations of things, thus penetrating and passing through the objects, to make their true nature known and apparent! This must thou use all thy life long, and upon all occasions: and then especially, when matters are apprehended as of great worth and respect, thy art and care must be to uncover them, and to behold their vileness, and to take away from them all those serious circumstances and expressions, under which they made so grave a show. For outward pomp and appearance is a great juggler; and then especially art thou most in danger to be beguiled by it, when (to a man's thinking) thou most seemest to be employed about matters of moment.\n\nXII. See what Crates pronounceth concerning Xenocrates himself.\n\nXIII. Those things which the common sort of people do admire, are most of them such things as are very general, and may be comprehended under things merely natural, or naturally affected and qualified: as stones, wood, figs, vines, olives. Those that be admired by them that are more moderate and restrained, are comprehended under things animated: as flocks and herds. Those that are yet more gentle and curious, their admiration is commonly confined to reasonable creatures only; not in general as they are reasonable, but as they are capable of art, or of some craft and subtile invention: or perchance barely to reasonable creatures; as they that delight in the possession of many slaves. But he that honours a reasonable soul in general, as it is reasonable and naturally sociable, doth little regard anything else: and above all things is careful to preserve his own, in the continual habit and exercise both of reason and sociableness: and thereby doth co-operate with him, of whose nature he doth also participate; God.\n\nXIV. Some things hasten to be, and others to he no more. And even whatsoever now is, some part thereof bath already perished. Perpetual fluxes and alterations renew the world, as the perpetual course of time doth make the age of the world (of itself infinite) to appear always fresh and new. In such a flux and course of all things, what of these things that hasten so fast away should any man regard, since among all there is not any that a man may fasten and fix upon? as if a man would settle his affection upon some ordinary sparrow living by him, who is no sooner seen, than out of sight. For we must not think otherwise of our lives, than as a mere exhalation of blood, or of an ordinary respiration of air. For what in our common apprehension is, to breathe in the air and to breathe it out again, which we do daily: so much is it and no more, at once to breathe out all thy respirative faculty into that common air from whence but lately (as being but from yesterday, and to-day), thou didst first breathe it in, and with it, life.\n\nXV. Not vegetative spiration, it is not surely (which plants have) that in this life should be so dear unto us; nor sensitive respiration, the proper life of beasts, both tame and wild; nor this our imaginative faculty; nor that we are subject to be led and carried up and down by the strength of our sensual appetites; or that we can gather, and live together; or that we can feed: for that in effect is no better, than that we can void the excrements of our food. What is it then that should be dear unto us? to hear a clattering noise? if not that, then neither to be applauded by the tongues of men. For the praises of many tongues, is in effect no better than the clattering of so many tongues. If then neither applause, what is there remaining that should be dear unto thee? This I think: that in all thy motions and actions thou be moved, and restrained according to thine own true natural constitution and Construction only. And to this even ordinary arts and professions do lead us. For it is that which every art doth aim at, that whatsoever it is, that is by art effected and prepared, may be fit for that work that it is prepared for. This is the end that he that dresseth the vine, and he that takes upon him either to tame colts, or to train up dogs, doth aim at. What else doth the education of children, and all learned professions tend unto? Certainly then it is that, which should be dear unto us also. If in this particular it go well with thee, care not for the obtaining of other things. But is it so, that thou canst not but respect other things also? Then canst not thou truly be free? then canst thou not have self-content: then wilt thou ever be subject to passions. For it is not possible, but that thou must be envious, and jealous, and suspicious of them whom thou knowest can bereave thee of such things; and again, a secret underminer of them, whom thou seest in present possession of that which is dear unto thee. To be short, he must of necessity be full of confusion within himself, and often accuse the Gods, whosoever stands in need of these things. But if thou shalt honour and respect thy mind only, that will make thee acceptable towards thyself, towards thy friends very tractable; and conformable and concordant with the Gods; that is, accepting with praises whatsoever they shall think good to appoint and allot unto thee.\n\nXVI. Under, above, and about, are the motions of the elements; but the motion of virtue, is none of those motions, but is somewhat more excellent and divine. Whose way (to speed and prosper in it) must be through a way, that is not easily comprehended.\n\nXVII. Who can choose but wonder at them? They will not speak well of them that are at the same time with them, and live with them; yet they themselves are very ambitious, that they that shall follow, whom they have never seen, nor shall ever see, should speak well of them. As if a man should grieve that he hath not been commended by them, that lived before him.\n\nXVIII. Do not ever conceive anything impossible to man, which by thee cannot, or not without much difficulty be effected; but whatsoever in general thou canst Conceive possible and proper unto any man, think that very possible unto thee also.\n\nXIX. Suppose that at the palestra somebody hath all to-torn thee with his nails, and hath broken thy head. Well, thou art wounded. Yet thou dost not exclaim; thou art not offended with him. Thou dost not suspect him for it afterwards, as one that watcheth to do thee a mischief. Yea even then, though thou dost thy best to save thyself from him, yet not from him as an enemy. It is not by way of any suspicious indignation, but by way of gentle and friendly declination. Keep the same mind and disposition in other parts of thy life also. For many things there be, which we must conceit and apprehend, as though we had had to do with an antagonist at the palestra. For as I said, it is very possible for us to avoid and decline, though we neither suspect, nor hate.\n\nXX. If anybody shall reprove me, and shall make it apparent unto me, that in any either opinion or action of mine I do err, I will most gladly retract. For it is the truth that I seek after, by which I am sure that never any man was hurt; and as sure, that he is hurt that continueth in any error, or ignorance whatsoever.\n\nXXI. I for my part will do what belongs unto me; as for other things, whether things unsensible or things irrational; or if rational, yet deceived and ignorant of the true way, they shall not trouble or distract me. For as for those creatures which are not endued with reason and all other things and-matters of the world whatsoever I freely, and generously, as one endued with reason, of things that have none, make use of them. And as for men, towards them as naturally partakers of the same reason, my care is to carry myself sociably. But whatsoever it is that thou art about, remember to call upon the Gods. And as for the time how long thou shalt live to do these things, let it be altogether indifferent unto thee, for even three such hours are sufficient.\n\nXXII. Alexander of Macedon, and he that dressed his mules, when once dead both came to one. For either they were both resumed into those original rational essences from whence all things in the world are propagated; or both after one fashion were scattered into atoms.\n\nXXIII Consider how many different things, whether they concern our bodies, or our souls, in a moment of time come to pass in every one of us, and so thou wilt not wonder if many more things or rather all things that are done, can at one time subsist, and coexist in that both one and general, which we call the world.\n\nXXIV. if any should put this question unto thee, how this word Antoninus is written, wouldst thou not presently fix thine intention upon it, and utter out in order every letter of it? And if any shall begin to gainsay thee, and quarrel with thee about it; wilt thou quarrel with him again, or rather go on meekly as thou hast begun, until thou hast numbered out every letter? Here then likewise remember, that every duty that belongs unto a man doth consist of some certain letters or numbers as it were, to which without any noise or tumult keeping thyself thou must orderly proceed to thy proposed end, forbearing to quarrel with him that would quarrel and fall out with thee.\n\nXXV. Is it not a cruel thing to forbid men to affect those things, which they conceive to agree best with their own natures, and to tend most to their own proper good and behoof? But thou after a sort deniest them this liberty, as often as thou art angry with them for their sins. For surely they are led unto those sins whatsoever they be, as to their proper good and commodity. But it is not so (thou wilt object perchance). Thou therefore teach them better, and make it appear unto them: but be not thou angry with them.\n\nXXVI. Death is a cessation from the impression of the senses, the tyranny of the passions, the errors of the mind, and the servitude of the body.\n\nXXVII. If in this kind of life thy body be able to hold out, it is a shame that thy soul should faint first, and give over. take heed, lest of a philosopher thou become a mere Caesar in time, and receive a new tincture from the court. For it may happen if thou dost not take heed. Keep thyself therefore, truly simple, good, sincere, grave, free from all ostentation, a lover of that which is just, religious, kind, tender-. hearted, strong and vigorous to undergo anything that becomes thee. Endeavour to continue such, as philosophy (hadst thou wholly and constantly applied thyself unto it) would have made, and secured thee. Worship the Gods, procure the welfare of men, this life is short. Charitable actions, and a holy disposition, is the only fruit of this earthly life.\n\nXXVIII. Do all things as becometh the disciple of Antoninus Pius. Remember his resolute constancy in things that were done by him according to reason, his equability in all things, his sanctity; the cheerfulness of his countenance, his sweetness, and how free he was from all vainglory; how careful to come to the true and exact knowledge of matters in hand, and how he would by no means give over till he did fully, and plainly understand the whole state of the business; and how patiently, and without any contestation he would bear with them, that did unjustly condemn him: how he would never be over-hasty in anything, nor give ear to slanders and false accusations, but examine and observe with best diligence the several actions and dispositions of men. Again, how he was no backbiter, nor easily frightened, nor suspicious, and in his language free from all affectation and curiosity: and how easily he would content himself with few things, as lodging, bedding, clothing, and ordinary nourishment, and attendance. How able to endure labour, how patient; able through his spare diet to continue from morning to evening without any necessity of withdrawing before his accustomed hours to the necessities of nature: his uniformity and constancy in matter of friendship. How he would bear with them that with all boldness and liberty opposed his opinions; and even rejoice if any man could better advise him: and lastly, how religious he was without superstition. All these things of him remember, that whensoever thy last hour shall come upon thee, it may find thee, as it did him, ready for it in the possession of a good conscience.\n\nXXIX. Stir up thy mind, and recall thy wits again from thy natural dreams, and visions, and when thou art perfectly awoken, and canst perceive that they were but dreams that troubled thee, as one newly awakened out of another kind of sleep look upon these worldly things with the same mind as thou didst upon those, that thou sawest in thy sleep.\n\nXXX. I consist of body and soul. Unto my body all things are indifferent, for of itself it cannot affect one thing more than another with apprehension of any difference; as for my mind, all things which are not within the verge of her own operation, are indifferent unto her, and for her own operations, those altogether depend of her; neither does she busy herself about any, but those that are present; for as for future and past operations, those also are now at this present indifferent unto her.\n\nXXXI. As long as the foot doth that which belongeth unto it to do, and the hand that which belongs unto it, their labour, whatsoever it be, is not unnatural. So a man as long as he doth that which is proper unto a man, his labour cannot be against nature; and if it be not against nature, then neither is it hurtful unto him. But if it were so that happiness did consist in pleasure: how came notorious robbers, impure abominable livers, parricides, and tyrants, in so large a measure to have their part of pleasures?\n\nXXXII. Dost thou not see, how even those that profess mechanic arts, though in some respect they be no better than mere idiots, yet they stick close to the course of their trade, neither can they find in their heart to decline from it: and is it not a grievous thing that an architect, or a physician shall respect the course and mysteries of their profession, more than a man the proper course and condition of his own nature, reason, which is common to him and to the Gods?\n\nXXXIII. Asia, Europe; what are they, but as corners of the whole world; of which the whole sea, is but as one drop; and the great Mount Athos, but as a clod, as all present time is but as one point of eternity. All, petty things; all things that are soon altered, soon perished. And all things come from one beginning; either all severally and particularly deliberated and resolved upon, by the general ruler and governor of all; or all by necessary consequence. So that the dreadful hiatus of a gaping lion, and all poison, and all hurtful things, are but (as the thorn and the mire) the necessary consequences of goodly fair things. Think not of these therefore, as things contrary to those which thou dost much honour, and respect; but consider in thy mind. the true fountain of all.\n\nXXXIV He that seeth the things that are now, hath Seen all that either was ever, or ever shall be, for all things are of one kind; and all like one unto another. Meditate often upon the connection of all things in the world; and upon the mutual relation that they have one unto another. For all things are after a sort folded and involved one within another, and by these means all agree well together. For one thing is consequent unto another, by local motion, by natural conspiration and agreement, and by substantial union, or, reduction of all substances into one.\n\nXXXV. Fit and accommodate thyself to that estate and to those occurrences, which by the destinies have been annexed unto thee; and love those men whom thy fate it is to live with; but love them truly. An instrument, a tool, an utensil, whatsoever it be, if it be fit for the purpose it was made for, it is as it should be though he perchance that made and fitted it, be out of sight and gone. But in things natural, that power which hath framed and fitted them, is and abideth within them still: for which reason she ought also the more to be respected, and we are the more obliged (if we may live and pass our time according to her purpose and intention) to think that all is well with us, and according to our own minds. After this manner also, and in this respect it is, that he that is all in all doth enjoy his happiness.\n\nXXXVI. What things soever are not within the proper power and jurisdiction of thine own will either to compass or avoid, if thou shalt propose unto thyself any of those things as either good, or evil; it must needs be that according as thou shalt either fall into that which thou dost think evil, or miss of that which thou dost think good, so wilt thou be ready both to complain of the Gods, and to hate those men, who either shall be so indeed, or shall by thee be suspected as the cause either of thy missing of the one, or falling into the other. And indeed we must needs commit many evils, if we incline to any of these things, more or less, with an opinion of any difference. But if we mind and fancy those things only, as good and bad, which wholly depend of our own wills, there is no more occasion why we should either murmur against the Gods, or be at enmity with any man.\n\nXXXVII. We all work to one effect, some willingly, and with a rational apprehension of what we do: others without any such knowledge. As I think Heraclitus in a place speaketh of them that sleep, that even they do work in their kind, and do confer to the general operations of the world. One man therefore doth co-operate after one sort, and another after another sort; but even he that doth murmur, and to his power doth resist and hinder; even he as much as any doth co-operate. For of such also did the world stand in need. Now do thou consider among which of these thou wilt rank thyself. For as for him who is the Administrator of all, he will make good use of thee whether thou wilt or no, and make thee (as a part and member of the whole) so to co-operate with him, that whatsoever thou doest, shall turn to the furtherance of his own counsels, and resolutions. But be not thou for shame such a part of the whole, as that vile and ridiculous verse (which Chrysippus in a place doth mention) is a part of the comedy.\n\nXXXVIII. Doth either the sun take upon him to do that which belongs to the rain? or his son Aesculapius that, which unto the earth doth properly belong? How is it with every one of the stars in particular? Though they all differ one from another, and have their several charges and functions by themselves, do they not all nevertheless concur and co-operate to one end?\n\nXXXIX. If so be that the Gods have deliberated in particular of those things that should happen unto me, I must stand to their deliberation, as discrete and wise. For that a God should be an imprudent God, is a thing hard even to conceive: and why should they resolve to do me hurt? for what profit either unto them or the universe (which they specially take care for) could arise from it? But if so be that they have not deliberated of me in particular, certainly they have of the whole in general, and those things which in consequence and coherence of this general deliberation happen unto me in particular, I am bound to embrace and accept of. But if so be that they have not deliberated at all (which indeed is very irreligious for any man to believe: for then let us neither sacrifice, nor pray, nor respect our oaths, neither let us any more use any of those things, which we persuaded of the presence and secret conversation of the Gods among us, daily use and practise:) but, I say, if so be that they have not indeed either in general, or particular deliberated of any of those things, that happen unto us in this world; yet God be thanked, that of those things that concern myself, it is lawful for me to deliberate myself, and all my deliberation is but concerning that which may be to me most profitable. Now that unto every one is most profitable, which is according to his own constitution and nature. And my nature is, to be rational in all my actions and as a good, and natural member of a city and commonwealth, towards my fellow members ever to be sociably and kindly disposed and affected. My city and country as I am Antoninus, is Rome; as a man, the whole world. Those things therefore that are expedient and profitable to those cities, are the only things that are good and expedient for me.\n\nXL. Whatsoever in any kind doth happen to any one, is expedient to the whole. And thus much to content us might suffice, that it is expedient for the whole in general. But yet this also shalt thou generally perceive, if thou dost diligently take heed, that whatsoever doth happen to any one man or men. . . . And now I am content that the word expedient, should more generally be understood of those things which we otherwise call middle things, or things indifferent; as health, wealth, and the like.\n\nXLI. As the ordinary shows of the theatre and of other such places, when thou art presented with them, affect thee; as the same things still seen, and in the same fashion, make the sight ingrateful and tedious; so must all the things that we see all our life long affect us. For all things, above and below, are still the same, and from the same causes. When then will there be an end?\n\nXLII. Let the several deaths of men of all sorts, and of all sorts of professions, and of all sort of nations, be a perpetual object of thy thoughts, . . . so that thou mayst even come down to Philistio, Phoebus, and Origanion. Pass now to other generations. Thither shall we after many changes, where so many brave orators are; where so many grave philosophers; Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Socrates. Where so many heroes of the old times; and then so many brave captains of the latter times; and so many kings. After all these, where Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes; where so many other sharp, generous, industrious, subtile, peremptory dispositions; and among others, even they, that have been the greatest scoffers and deriders of the frailty and brevity of this our human life; as Menippus, and others, as many as there have been such as he. Of all these consider, that they long since are all dead, and gone. And what do they suffer by it! Nay they that have not so much as a name remaining, what are they the worse for it? One thing there is, and that only, which is worth our while in this world, and ought by us much to be esteemed; and that is, according to truth and righteousness, meekly and lovingly to converse with false, and unrighteous men.\n\nXLIII. When thou wilt comfort and cheer thyself, call to mind the several gifts and virtues of them, whom thou dost daily converse with; as for example, the industry of the one; the modesty of another; the liberality of a third; of another some other thing. For nothing can so much rejoice thee, as the resemblances and parallels of several virtues, visible and eminent in the dispositions of those who live with thee; especially when, all at once, as near as may be, they represent themselves unto thee. And therefore thou must have them always in a readiness.\n\nXLIV. Dost thou grieve that thou dost weigh but so many pounds, and not three hundred rather? Just as much reason hast thou to grieve that thou must live but so many years, and not longer. For as for bulk and substance thou dost content thyself with that proportion of it that is allotted unto thee, so shouldst thou for time.\n\nXLV. Let us do our best endeavours to persuade them ; but however, if reason and justice lead thee to it, do it, though they be never so much against it. But if any shall by force withstand thee, and hinder thee in it, convert thy virtuous inclination from one object unto another, from justice to contented equanimity, and cheerful patience: so that what in the one is thy hindrance, thou mayst make use of it for the exercise of another virtue: and remember that it was with due exception, and reservation, that thou didst at first incline and desire. For thou didst not set thy mind upon things impossible. Upon what then? that all thy desires might ever be moderated with this due kind of reservation. And this thou hast, and mayst always obtain, whether the thing desired be in thy power or no. And what do I care for more, if that for which I was born and brought forth into the world (to rule all my desires with reason and discretion) may be?\n\nXLVI. The ambitious supposeth another man's act, praise and applause, to be his own happiness; the voluptuous his own sense and feeling; but he that is wise, his own action.\n\nXLVII. It is in thy power absolutely to exclude all manner of conceit and opinion, as concerning this matter; and by the same means, to exclude all grief and sorrow from thy soul. For as for the things and objects themselves, they of themselves have no such power, whereby to beget and force upon us any opinion at all.\n\nXLVIII. Use thyself when any man speaks unto thee, so to hearken unto him, as that in the interim thou give not way to any other thoughts; that so thou mayst (as far as is possible) seem fixed and fastened to his very soul, whosoever he be that speaks unto thee.\n\nXLIX. That which is not good for the bee-hive, cannot be good for the bee.\n\nL. Will either passengers, or patients, find fault and complain, either the one if they be well carried, or the others if well cured? Do they take care for any more than this; the one, that their shipmaster may bring them safe to land, and the other, that their physician may effect their recovery?\n\nLI. How many of them who came into the world at the same time when I did, are already gone out of it?\n\nLII. To them that are sick of the jaundice, honey seems bitter; and to them that are bitten by a mad dog, the water terrible; and to children, a little ball seems a fine thing. And why then should I be angry? or do I think that error and false opinion is less powerful to make men transgress, than either choler, being immoderate and excessive, to cause the jaundice; or poison, to cause rage?\n\nLIII. No man can hinder thee to live as thy nature doth require. Nothing can happen unto thee, but what the common good of nature doth require.\n\nLIV. What manner of men they be whom they seek to please, and what to get, and by what actions: how soon time will cover and bury all things, and how many it hath already buried!\n\n\n\nTHE SEVENTH BOOK\n\n\nI. What is wickedness? It is that which many time and often thou hast already seen and known in the world. And so oft as anything doth happen that might otherwise trouble thee, let this memento presently come to thy mind, that it is that which thou hast already often Seen and known. Generally, above and below, thou shalt find but the same things. The very same things whereof ancient stories, middle age stories, and fresh stories are full whereof towns are full, and houses full. There is nothing that is new. All things that are, are both usual and of little continuance.\n\nII. What fear is there that thy dogmata, or philosophical resolutions and conclusions, should become dead in thee, and lose their proper power and efficacy to make thee live happy, as long as those proper and correlative fancies, and representations of things on which they mutually depend (which continually to stir up and revive is in thy power,) are still kept fresh and alive? It is in my power concerning this thing that is happened, what soever it be, to conceit that which is right and true. If it be, why then am I troubled? Those things that are without my understanding, are nothing to it at all: and that is it only, which doth properly concern me. Be always in this mind, and thou wilt be right.\n\nIII. That which most men would think themselves most happy for, and would prefer before all things, if the Gods would grant it unto them after their deaths, thou mayst whilst thou livest grant unto thyself; to live again. See the things of the world again, as thou hast already seen them. For what is it else to live again? Public shows and solemnities with much pomp and vanity, stage plays, flocks and herds; conflicts and con tentions: a bone thrown to a company of hungry curs; a bait for greedy fishes; the painfulness, and continual burden-bearing of wretched ants, the running to and fro of terrified mice: little puppets drawn up and down with wires and nerves: these be the objects of the world. among all these thou must stand steadfast, meekly affected, and free from all manner of indignation; with this right ratiocination and apprehension; that as the worth is of those things which a man doth affect, so is in very deed every man's worth more or less.\n\nIV. Word after word, every one by itself, must the things that are spoken be conceived and understood; and so the things that are done, purpose after purpose, every one by itself likewise. And as in matter of purposes and actions, we must presently see what is the proper use and relation of every one; so of words must we be as ready, to consider of every one what is the true meaning, and signification of it according to truth and nature, however it be taken in common use.\n\nV. Is my reason, and understanding sufficient for this, or no? If it be sufficient, without any private applause, or public ostentation as of an instrument, which by nature I am provided of, I will make use of it for the work in hand, as of an instrument, which by nature I am provided of. if it be not, and that otherwise it belong not unto me particularly as a private duty, I will either give it over, and leave it to some other that can better effect it: or I will endeavour it; but with the help of some other, who with the joint help of my reason, is able to bring somewhat to pass, that will now be seasonable and useful for the common good. For whatsoever I do either by myself, or with some other, the only thing that I must intend, is, that it be good and expedient for the public. For as for praise, consider how many who once were much commended, are now already quite forgotten, yea they that commended them, how even they themselves are long since dead and gone. Be not therefore ashamed, whensoever thou must use the help of others. For whatsoever it be that lieth upon thee to effect, thou must propose it unto thyself, as the scaling of walls is unto a soldier. And what if thou through either lameness or some other impediment art not able to reach unto the top of the battlements alone, which with the help of another thou mayst; wilt thou therefore give it over, or go about it with less courage and alacrity. because thou canst not effect it all alone?\n\nVI. Let not things future trouble thee. For if necessity so require that they come to pass, thou shalt (whensoever that is) be provided for them with the same reason, by which whatsoever is now present, is made both tolerable and acceptable unto thee. All things are linked and knitted together, and the knot is sacred, neither is there anything in the world, that is not kind and natural in regard of any other thing, or, that hath not some kind of reference and natural correspondence with whatsoever is in the world besides. For all things are ranked together, and by that decency of its due place and order that each particular doth observe, they all concur together to the making of one and the same [\"Kosmos\" ed] or world: as if you said, a comely piece, or an orderly composition. For all things throughout, there is but one and the same order; and through all things, one and the same God, the same substance and the same law. There is one common reason, and one common truth, that belongs unto all reasonable creatures, for neither is there save one perfection of all creatures that are of the same kind, and partakers of the same reason.\n\nVII. Whatsoever is material, doth soon vanish away into the common substance of the whole; and whatsoever is formal, or, whatsoever doth animate that which is material, is soon resumed into the common reason of the whole; and the fame and memory of anything, is soon swallowed up by the general age and duration of the whole.\n\nVIII. To a reasonable creature, the same action is both according to nature, and according to reason.\n\nIX. Straight of itself, not made straight.\n\nX. As several members in one body united, so are reasonable creatures in a body divided and dispersed, all made and prepared for one common operation. And this thou shalt apprehend the better, if thou shalt use thyself often to say to thyself, I am meloz, or a member of the mass and body of reasonable substances. But if thou shalt say I am meroz, or a part, thou dost not yet love men from thy heart. The joy that thou takest in the exercise of bounty, is not yet grounded upon a due ratiocination and right apprehension of the nature of things. Thou dost exercise it as yet upon this ground barely, as a thing convenient and fitting; not, as doing good to thyself, when thou dost good unto others.\n\nXI. Of things that are external, happen what will to that which can suffer by external accidents. Those things that suffer let them complain themselves, if they will; as for me, as long as I conceive no such thing, that that which is happened is evil, I have no hurt; and it is in my power not to conceive any such thing.\n\nXII. Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, thou must be good; not for any man's sake, but for thine own nature's sake; as if either gold, or the emerald, or purple, should ever be saying to themselves, Whatsoever any man either doth or saith, I must still be an emerald, and I must keep my colour.\n\nXIII. This may ever be my comfort and security: my understanding, that ruleth over all, will not of itself bring trouble and vexation upon itself. This I say; it will not put itself in any fear, it will not lead itself into any concupiscence. If it be in the power of any other to compel it to fear, or to grieve, it is free for him to use his power. But sure if itself do not of itself, through some false opinion or supposition incline itself to any such disposition; there is no fear. For as for the body, why should I make the grief of my body, to be the grief of my mind? If that itself can either fear or complain, let it. But as for the soul, which indeed, can only be truly sensible of either fear or grief; to which only it belongs according to its different imaginations and opinions, to admit of either of these, or of their contraries; thou mayst look to that thyself, that it suffer nothing. Induce her not to any such opinion or persuasion. The understanding is of itself sufficient unto itself, and needs not (if itself doth not bring itself to need) any other thing besides itself, and by consequent as it needs nothing, so neither can it be troubled or hindered by anything, if itself doth not trouble and hinder itself.\n\nXIV. What is ευδαιμονία, or happiness: but αγαθός δαίμων, or, a good daemon, or spirit? What then dost thou do here, O opinion? By the Gods I adjure thee, that thou get thee gone, as thou earnest: for I need thee not. Thou earnest indeed unto me according to thy ancient wonted manner. It is that, that all men have ever been subject unto. That thou camest therefore I am not angry with thee, only begone, now that I have found thee what thou art.\next\nXV. Is any man so foolish as to fear change, to which all things that once were not owe their being? And what is it, that is more pleasing and more familiar to the nature of the universe? How couldst thou thyself use thy ordinary hot baths, should not the wood that heateth them first be changed? How couldst thou receive any nourishment from those things that thou hast eaten, if they should not be changed? Can anything else almost (that is useful and profitable) be brought to pass without change? How then dost not thou perceive, that for thee also, by death, to come to change, is a thing of the very same nature, and as necessary for the nature of the universe?\n\nXVI. Through the substance of the universe, as through a torrent pass all particular bodies, being all of the same nature, and all joint workers with the universe itself as in one of our bodies so many members among themselves. How many such as Chrysippus, how many such as Socrates, how many such as Epictetus, hath the age of the world long since swallowed up and devoured? Let this, be it either men or businesses, that thou hast occasion to think of, to the end that thy thoughts be not distracted and thy mind too earnestly set upon anything, upon every such occasion presently come to thy mind. Of all my thoughts and cares, one only thing shall be the object, that I myself do nothing which to the proper constitution of man, (either in regard of the thing itself, or in regard of the manner, or of the time of doing,) is contrary. The time when thou shalt have forgotten all things, is at hand. And that time also is at hand, when thou thyself shalt be forgotten by all. Whilst thou art, apply thyself to that especially which unto man as he is a mart, is most proper and agreeable, and that is, for a man even to love them that transgress against him. This shall be, if at the same time that any such thing doth happen, thou call to mind, that they are thy kinsmen; that it is through ignorance and against their wills that they sin; and that within a very short while after, both thou and he shall be no more. But above all things, that he hath not done thee any hurt; for that by him thy mind and understanding is not made worse or more vile than it was before.\n\nXVII. The nature of the universe, of the common substance of all things as it were of so much wax hath now perchance formed a horse; and then, destroying that figure, hath new tempered and fashioned the matter of it into the form and substance of a tree: then that again into the form and substance of a man: and then that again into some other. Now every one of these doth subsist but for a very little while. As for dissolution, if it be no grievous thing to the chest or trunk, to be joined together; why should it be more grievous to be put asunder?\n\nXVIII. An angry countenance is much against nature, and it is oftentimes the proper countenance of them that are at the point of death. But were it so, that all anger and passion were so thoroughly quenched in thee, that it were altogether impossible to kindle it any more, yet herein must not thou rest satisfied, but further endeavour by good consequence of true ratiocination, perfectly to conceive and understand, that all anger and passion is against reason. For if thou shalt not be sensible of thine innocence; if that also shall be gone from thee, the comfort of a good conscience, that thou doest all things according to reason: what shouldest thou live any longer for? All things that now thou seest, are but for a moment. That nature, by which all things in the world are administered, will soon bring change and alteration upon them, and then of their substances make other things like unto them : and then soon after others again of the matter and substance of these: that so by these means, the world may still appear fresh and new.\n\nXIX. Whensoever any man doth trespass against other, presently consider with thyself what it was that he did suppose to be good, what to be evil, when he did trespass. For this when thou knowest, thou wilt pity him thou wilt have no occasion either to wonder, or to be angry. For either thou thyself dust yet live in that error and ignorance, as that thou dust suppose either that very thing that he doth, or some other like worldly thing, to be good; and so thou art bound to pardon him if he have done that which thou in the like case wouldst have done thyself. Or if so be that thou dost not any more suppose the same things to be good or evil, that he doth; how canst thou but be gentle unto him that is in an error?\n\nXX. Fancy not to thyself things future, as though they were present but of those that are present, take some aside, that thou takest most benefit of, and consider of them particularly, how wonderfully thou wouldst want them, if they were not present. But take heed withal, lest that whilst thou dust settle thy contentment in things present, thou grow in time so to overprize them, as that the want of them (whensoever it shall so fall out) should be a trouble and a vexation unto thee. Wind up thyself into thyself. Such is the nature of thy reasonable commanding part, as that if it exercise justice, and have by that means tranquillity within itself, it doth rest fully satisfied with itself without any other thing.\n\nXXI. Wipe off all opinion stay the force and violence of unreasonable lusts and affections: circumscribe the present time examine whatsoever it be that is happened, either to thyself or to another: divide all present objects, either in that which is formal or material think of the last hour. That which thy neighbour bath committed, where the guilt of it lieth, there let it rest. Examine in order whatsoever is spoken. Let thy mind penetrate both into the effects, and into the causes. Rejoice thyself with true simplicity, and modesty; and that all middle things between virtue and vice are indifferent unto thee. Finally, love mankind; obey God.\n\nXXII. All things (saith he) are by certain order and appointment. And what if the elements only. It will suffice to remember, that all things in general are by certain order and appointment: or if it be but few. And as concerning death, that either dispersion, or the atoms, or annihilation, or extinction, or translation will ensue. And as concerning pain, that that which is intolerable is soon ended by death; and that which holds long must needs be tolerable; and that the mind in the meantime (which is all in all) may by way of jnterclusion, or interception, by stopping all manner of commerce and sympathy with the body, still retain its own tranquillity. Thy understanding is not made worse by it. As for those parts that suffer, let them, if they can, declare their grief themselves. As for praise and commendation, view their mind and understanding, what estate they are in; what kind of things they fly, and what things they seek after: and that as in the seaside, whatsoever was before to be seen, is by the continual succession of new heaps of sand cast up one upon another, soon hid and covered; so in this life, all former things by those which immediately succeed.\n\nXXIII. Out of Plato. 'He then whose mind is endowed with true magnanimity, who hath accustomed himself to the contemplation both of all times, and of all things in general; can this mortal life (thinkest thou) seem any great matter unto him? It is not possible, answered he. Then neither will such a one account death a grievous thing? By no means.'\n\nXXIV. Out of Antisthenes. 'It is a princely thing to do well, and to be ill-spoken of. It is a shameful thing that the face should be subject unto the mind, to be put into what shape it will, and to be dressed by it as it will; and that the mind should not bestow so much care upon herself, as to fashion herself, and to dress herself as best becometh her.'\n\nXXV. Out of several poets and comics. 'It will but little avail thee, to turn thine anger and indignation upon the things themselves that have fallen across unto thee. For as for them, they are not sensible of it, &c. Thou shalt but make thyself a laughing-stock; both unto the Gods and men, &c. Our life is reaped like a ripe ear of corn; one is yet standing and another is down, &c. But if so be that I and my children be neglected by the gods, there is some reason even for that, &c. As long as right and equity is of my side, &c. Not to lament with them, not to tremble, &c'\n\nXXVI. Out of Plato. 'My answer, full of justice and equity, should be this: Thy speech is not right, O man! if thou supposest that he that is of any worth at all, should apprehend either life or death, as a matter of great hazard and danger; and should not make this rather his only care, to examine his own actions, whether just or unjust: whether actions of a good, or of a wicked man, &c. For thus in very truth stands the case, O ye men of Athens. What place or station soever a man either hath chosen to himself, judging it best for himself; or is by lawful authority put and settled in, therein do I think (all appearance of danger notwithstanding) that he should continue, as one who feareth neither death, nor anything else, so much as he feareth to commit anything that is vicious and shameful, &c. But, O noble sir, consider I pray, whether true generosity and true happiness, do not consist in somewhat else rather, than in the preservation either of our, or other men's lives. For it is not the part of a man that is a man indeed, to desire to live long or to make much of his life whilst he Iiveth: but rather (he that is such) will in these things wholly refer himself unto the Gods, and believing that which every woman can tell him, that no man can escape death; the only thing that he takes thought and care for is this, that what time he liveth, he may live as well and as virtuously as he can possibly, &c. To look about, and with the eyes to follow the course of the stars and planets as though thou wouldst run with them; and to mind perpetually the several changes of the elements one into another. For such fancies and imaginations, help much to purge away the dross and filth of this our earthly life,' &c. That also is a fine passage of Plato's, where he speaketh of worldly things in these words: 'Thou must also as from some higher place look down, as it were, upon the things of this world, as flocks, armies, husbandmen's labours, marriages, divorces, generations, deaths: the tumults of courts and places of judicatures; desert places; the several nations of barbarians, public festivals, mournmgs, fairs, markets.' How all things upon earth are pell-mell; and how miraculously things contrary one to another, concur to the beauty and perfection of this universe.\n\nXXVII. To look back upon things of former ages, as upon the manifold changes and conversions of several monarchies and commonwealths. We may also foresee things future, for they shall all be of the same kind; neither is it possible that they should leave the tune, or break the concert that is now begun, as it were, by these things that are now done and brought to pass in the world. It comes all to one therefore, whether a man be a spectator of the things of this life but forty years, or whether he see them ten thousand years together: for what shall he see more? 'And as for those parts that came from the earth, they shall return unto the earth again; and those that came from heaven, they also shall return unto those heavenly places.' Whether it be a mere dissolution and unbinding of the manifold intricacies and entanglements of the confused atoms; or some such dispersion of the simple and incorruptible elements . . . 'With meats and drinks and divers charms, they seek to divert the channel, that they might not die. Yet must we needs endure that blast of wind that cometh from above, though we toil and labour never so much.'\n\nXXVIII. He hath a stronger body, and is a better wrestler than I. What then? Is he more bountiful? is he more modest? Doth he bear all adverse chances with more equanimity: or with his neighbour's offences with more meekness and gentleness than I?\n\nXXIX. Where the matter may be effected agreeably to that reason, which both unto the Gods and men is common, there can be no just cause of grief or sorrow. For where the fruit and benefit of an action well begun and prosecuted according to the proper constitution of man may be reaped and obtained, or is sure and certain, it is against reason that any damage should there be suspected. In all places, and at all times, it is in thy power religiously to embrace whatsoever by God's appointment is happened unto thee, and justly to converse with those men, whom thou hast to do with, and accurately to examine every fancy that presents itself, that nothing may slip and steal in, before thou hast rightly apprehended the true nature of it.\n\nXXX. Look not about upon other men's minds and understandings; but look right on forwards whither nature, both that of the universe, in those things that happen unto thee; and thine in particular, in those things that are done by thee: doth lead, and direct thee. Now every one is bound to do that, which is consequent and agreeable to that end which by his true natural constitution he was ordained unto. As for all other things, they are ordained for the use of reasonable creatures: as in all things we see that that which is worse and inferior, is made for that which is better. Reasonable creatures, they are ordained one for another. That therefore which is chief in every man's constitution, is, that he intend the common good. The second is, that he yield not to any lusts and motions of the flesh. For it is the part and privilege of the reasonable and intellective faculty, that she can so bound herself, as that neither the sensitive, nor the appetitive faculties, may not anyways prevail upon her. For both these are brutish. And therefore over both she challengeth mastery, and cannot anyways endure, if in her right temper, to be subject unto either. And this indeed most justly. For by nature she was ordained to command all in the body. The third thing proper to man by his constitution, is, to avoid all rashness and precipitancy; and not to be subject to error. To these things then, let the mind apply herself and go straight on, without any distraction about other things, and she hath her end, and by consequent her happiness.\n\nXXXI. As one who had lived, and were now to die by right, whatsoever is yet remaining, bestow that wholly as a gracious overplus upon a virtuous life. Love and affect that only, whatsoever it be that happeneth, and is by the fates appointed unto thee. For what can be more reasonable? And as anything doth happen unto thee by way of cross, or calamity, call to mind presently and set before thine eyes, the examples of some other men, to whom the self-same thing did once happen likewise. Well, what did they? They grieved; they wondered ; they complained. And where are they now? All dead and gone. Wilt thou also be like one of them? Or rather leaving to men of the world (whose life both in regard of themselves, and them that they converse with, is nothing but mere mutability; or men of as fickle minds, as fickle bodies; ever changing and soon changed themselves: let it be thine only care and study, how to make a right use of all such accidents. For there is good use to be made of them, and they will prove fit matter for thee to work upon, if it shall be both thy care and thy desire, that whatsoever thou doest, thou thyself mayst like and approve thyself for it. And both these, see, that thou remember well, according as the diversity of the matter of the action that thou art about shall require. Look within; within is the fountain of all good. Such a fountain, where springing waters can never fail, so thou dig still deeper and deeper.\n\nXXXII. Thou must use thyself also to keep thy body fixed and steady; free from all loose fluctuant either motion, or posture. And as upon thy face and looks, thy mind hath easily power over them to keep them to that which is grave and decent; so let it challenge the same power over the whole body also. But so observe all things in this kind, as that it be without any manner of affectation.\n\nXXXIII. The art of true living in this world is more like a wrestler's, than a dancer's practice. For in this they both agree, to teach a man whatsoever falls upon him, that he may be ready for it, and that nothing may cast him down.\n\nXXXIV. Thou must continually ponder and consider with thyself, what manner of men they be, and for their minds and understandings what is their present estate, whose good word and testimony thou dost desire. For then neither wilt thou see cause to complain of them that offend against their wills; or find any want of their applause, if once thou dost but penetrate into the true force and ground both of their opinions, and of their desires. 'No soul (saith he) is willingly bereft of the truth,' and by consequent, neither of justice, or temperance, or kindness, and mildness; nor of anything that is of the same kind. It is most needful that thou shouldst always remember this. For so shalt thou be far more gentle and moderate towards all men.\n\nXXXV. What pain soever thou art in, let this presently come to thy mind, that it is not a thing whereof thou needest to be ashamed, neither is it a thing whereby thy understanding, that hath the government of all, can be made worse. For neither in regard of the substance of it, nor in regard of the end of it (which is, to intend the common good) can it alter and corrupt it. This also of Epicurus mayst thou in most pains find some help of, that it is 'neither intolerable, nor eternal;' so thou keep thyself to the true bounds and limits of reason and give not way to opinion. This also thou must consider, that many things there be, which oftentimes unsensibly trouble and vex thee, as not armed against them with patience, because they go not ordinarily under the name of pains, which in very deed are of the same nature as pain; as to slumber unquietly, to suffer heat, to want appetite: when therefore any of these things make thee discontented, check thyself with these words: Now hath pain given thee the foil; thy courage hath failed thee.\n\nXXXVI. Take heed lest at any time thou stand so affected, though towards unnatural evil men, as ordinary men are commonly one towards another.\n\nXXXVII. How know we whether Socrates were so eminent indeed, and of so extraordinary a disposition? For that he died more gloriously, that he disputed with the Sophists more subtilly; that he watched in the frost more assiduously; that being commanded to fetch innocent Salaminius, he refused to do it more generously; all this will not serve. Nor that he walked in the streets, with much gravity and majesty, as was objected unto him by his adversaries: which nevertheless a man may well doubt of, whether it were so or no, or, which above all the rest, if so be that it were true, a man would well consider of, whether commendable, or discommendable. The thing therefore that we must inquire into, is this; what manner of soul Socrates had: whether his disposition was such; as that all that he stood upon, and sought after in this world, was barely this, that he might ever carry himself justly towards men, and holily towards the Gods. Neither vexing himself to no purpose at the wickedness of others, nor yet ever condescending to any man's evil fact, or evil intentions, through either fear, or engagement of friendship. Whether of those things that happened unto him by God's appointment, he neither did wonder at any when it did happen, or thought it intolerable in the trial of it. And lastly, whether he never did suffer his mind to sympathise with the senses, and affections of the body. For we must not think that Nature hath so mixed and tempered it with the body, as that she hath not power to circumscribe herself, and by herself to intend her own ends and occasions.\n\nXXXVIII. For it is a thing very possible, that a man should be a very divine man, and yet be altogether unknown. This thou must ever be mindful of, as of this also, that a man's true happiness doth consist in very few things. And that although thou dost despair, that thou shalt ever be a good either logician, or naturalist, yet thou art never the further off by it from being either liberal, or modest, or charitable, or obedient unto God.\n\nXXXIX. Free from all compulsion in all cheerfulness and alacrity thou mayst run out thy time, though men should exclaim against thee never so much, and the wild beasts should pull in sunder the poor members of thy pampered mass of flesh. For what in either of these or the like cases should hinder the mind to retain her own rest and tranquillity, consisting both in the right judgment of those things that happen unto her, and in the ready use of all present matters and occasions? So that her judgment may say, to that which is befallen her by way of cross: this thou art in very deed, and according to thy true nature: notwithstanding that in the judgment of opinion thou dust appear otherwise: and her discretion to the present object; thou art that, which I sought for. For whatsoever it be, that is now present, shall ever be embraced by me as a fit and seasonable object, both for my reasonable faculty, and for my sociable, or charitable inclination to work upon. And that which is principal in this matter, is that it may be referred either unto the praise of God, or to the good of men. For either unto God or man, whatsoever it is that doth happen in the world hath in the ordinary course of nature its proper reference; neither is there anything, that in regard of nature is either new, or reluctant and intractable, but all things both usual and easy.\n\nXL. Then hath a man attained to the estate of perfection in his life and conversation, when he so spends every day, as if it were his last day: never hot and vehement in his affections, nor yet so cold and stupid as one that had no sense; and free from all manner of dissimulation.\n\nXLI. Can the Gods, who are immortal, for the continuance of so many ages bear without indignation with such and so many sinners, as have ever been, yea not only so, but also take such care for them, that they want nothing; and dust thou so grievously take on, as one that could bear with them no longer; thou that art but for a moment of time? yea thou that art one of those sinners thyself? A very ridiculous thing it is, that any man should dispense with vice and wickedness in himself, which is in his power to restrain; and should go about to suppress it in others, which is altogether impossible.\n\nXLII. What object soever, our reasonable and sociable faculty doth meet with, that affords nothing either for the satisfaction of reason, or for the practice of charity, she worthily doth think unworthy of herself.\n\nXLIII. When thou hast done well, and another is benefited by thy action, must thou like a very fool look for a third thing besides, as that it may appear unto others also that thou hast done well, or that thou mayest in time, receive one good turn for another? No man useth to be weary of that which is beneficial unto him. But every action according to nature, is beneficial. Be not weary then of doing that which is beneficial unto thee, whilst it is so unto others.\n\nXLIV. The nature of the universe did once certainly before it was created, whatsoever it hath done since, deliberate and so resolve upon the creation of the world. Now since that time, whatsoever it is, that is and happens in the world, is either but a consequent of that one and first deliberation: or if so be that this ruling rational part of the world, takes any thought and care of things particular, they are surely his reasonable and principal creatures, that are the proper object of his particular care and providence. This often thought upon, will much conduce to thy tranquillity.\n\n\n\nTHE EIGHTH BOOK\n\n\nI. This also, among other things, may serve to keep thee from vainglory; if thou shalt consider, that thou art now altogether incapable of the commendation of one, who all his life long, or from his youth at least, hath lived a philosopher's life. For both unto others, and to thyself especially, it is well known, that thou hast done many things contrary to that perfection of life. Thou hast therefore been confounded in thy course, and henceforth it will be hard for thee to recover the title and credit of a philosopher. And to it also is thy calling and profession repugnant. If therefore thou dost truly understand, what it is that is of moment indeed; as for thy fame and credit, take no thought or care for that: let it suffice thee if all the rest of thy life, be it more or less, thou shalt live as thy nature requireth, or accoring to the true and natural end of thy making. Take pains therefore to know what it is that thy nature requireth, and let nothing else distract thee. Thou hast already had sufficient experience, that of those many things that hitherto thou hast erred and wandered about, thou couldst not find happiness in any of them. Not in syllogisms, and logical subtilties, not in wealth, not in honour and reputation, not in pleasure. In none of all these. Wherein then is it to be found? In the practice of those things, which the nature of man, as he is a man, doth require. How then shall he do those things? if his dogmata, or moral tenets and opinions (from which all motions and actions do proceed), be right and true. Which be those dogmata? Those that concern that which is good or evil, as that there is nothing truly good and beneficial unto man, but that which makes him just, temperate, courageous, liberal; and that there is nothing truly evil and hurtful unto man, but that which causeth the contrary effects.\n\nII. Upon every action that thou art about, put this question to thyself; How will this when it is done agree with me? Shall I have no occasion to repent of it? Yet a very little while and I am dead and gone; and all things are at end. What then do I care for more than this, that my present action whatsoever it be, may be the proper action of one that is reasonable; whose end is, the common good; who in all things is ruled and governed by the same law of right and reason, by which God Himself is.\n\nIII. Alexander, Caius, Pompeius; what are these to Diogenes, Heraclitus, and Socrates? These penetrated into the true nature of things; into all causes, and all subjects: and upon these did they exercise their power and authority. But as for those, as the extent of their error was, so far did their slavery extend.\n\nIV. What they have done, they will still do, although thou shouldst hang thyself. First; let it not trouble thee. For all things both good and evil: come to pass according to the nature and general condition of the universe, and within a very little while, all things will be at an end; no man will be remembered: as now of Africanus (for example) and Augustus it is already come to pass. Then secondly; fix thy mind upon the thing itself; look into it, and remembering thyself, that thou art bound nevertheless to be a good man, and what it is that thy nature requireth of thee as thou art a man, be not diverted from what thou art about, and speak that which seemeth unto thee most just: only speak it kindly, modestly, and without hypocrisy.\n\nV. That which the nature of the universe dotb busy herself about, is; that which is here, to transfer it thither, to change it, and thence again to take it away, and to carry it to another place. So that thou needest not fear any new thing. For all things are usual and ordinary; and all things are disposed by equality.\n\nVI. Every particular nature hath content, when in its own proper course it speeds. A reasonable nature doth then speed, when first in matter of fancies and imaginations, it gives no consent to that which is either false uncertain. Secondly, when in all its motions and resolutions it takes its level at the common good only, and that it desireth nothing, and flieth from nothing, bet what is in its own power to compass or avoid. And lastly, when it willingly and gladly embraceth, whatsoever is dealt and appointed unto it by the common nature. For it is part of it; even as the nature of any one leaf, is part of the common nature of all plants and trees. But that the nature of a leaf, is part of a nature both unreasonable and unsensibIe, and which in its proper end may be hindered; or, which is servile and slavish : whereas the nature of man is part of a common nature which cannot be hindered, and which is both reasonable and just. From whence also it is, that accord ing to the worth of everything, she doth make such equal distribution of all things, as of duration, substance form, operation, and of events and accidents. But herein consider not whether thou shalt find this equality rn everything abu;oluteiy and by itself; but whether in all the particulars of some one thing taken together, and compared with all the particulars of some other thing, and them together likewise. VII. Thou hast no time nor opportunity to read. What then? Hast thou not time and opportunity to exercise thyself, not to wrong thyself; to strive against all carnal pleasures and pains, and to aet the upper hand of them; to contemn honour and vainglory; and not only, not to be angry with them, whom towards thee thou doest find unsensible and unthankful; but also to have a care of them still, and of their welfare?\n\nVIII. Forbear henceforth to complain of the trouble of a courtly life, either in public before others, or in private by thyself.\n\nIX. Repentance is an inward and self-reprehension for the neglect or omission of somewhat that was profitable. Now whatsoever is good, is also profltable, and it is the part of an honest virtuous man to set by it, and to make reckoning of it accordingly. But never did any honest virtuous man repent of the neglect or omission of any carnal pleasure : no carnal pleasure then is either good or profitable.\n\nX. This, what is it in itself, and by itself, according to its proper constitution? What is the substance of it? What is the matter, or proper use ? What is the form or efflcient cause? What is it for in this world, and how long will it abide? Thus must thou examine all things, that present themselves unto thee.\n\nXI. When thou art hard to be stirred up and awaked out of thy sleep, admonish thyself and call to mind, that, to perform actions tending to the common good is that which thine own proper constitution, and that which the nature of man do require. But to sleep, is common to unreasonable creatures also. And what more proper and natural, yea what more kind and pleasing, than that which is according to nature?\n\nXII. As every fancy and imagination presents itself unto thee, consider (if it be possible) the true nature, and the proper qualities of it, and reason with thyself about it.\n\nXIII. At thy first encounter with any one, say presently to thyself: This man, what are his opinions concerning that which is good or evil? as concerning pain, pleasure, and the causes of both; concerning honour, and dishonour, concerning life and death? thus and thus. Now if it be no wonder that a man should have such and such opinions, how can it be a wonder that he should do such and such things ? I will remember then, that he cannot but do as he doth, holding those opinions that he doth. Remember, that as it is a shame for any man to wonder that a fig tree should bear figs, so also to wonder that the world should bear anything, whatsoever it is which in the ordinary course of nature it may bear. To a physician also and to a pilot it is a shame either for the one to wonder, that such and such a one should have an ague; or for the other, that the winds should prove Contrary.\n\nXIV. Remember, that to change thy mind upon occasion, and to follow him that is able to rectify thee, is equally ingenuous, as to find out at the first, what is right and just, without help. For of thee nothing is required, ti, is beyond the extent of thine own deliberation and jun. merit, arid of thine own understanding.\n\nXV. If it were thine act and in thine own power, wouldest thou do it? If it were not, whom dost thou accuse? the atoms, or the Gods? For to do either, the part of a mad man. Thou must therefore blame nobody, but if it be in thy power, redress what is amiss; if it be not, to what end is it to complain? For nothing should be done but to some certain end.\n\nXVI. Whatsoever dieth and falleth, however and wheresoever it die and fall, it cannot fall out of the world. here it have its abode and change, here also shall it have its dissolution into its proper elements. The same are the world's elements, and the elements of which thou dost consist. And they when they are changed, they murmur not; why shouldest thou?\n\nXVII. Whatsoever is, was made for something: as a horse, a vine. Why wonderest thou? The sun itself will say of itself, I was made for something; and so hath every god its proper function. What then were then made for? to disport and delight thyself? See how even common sense and reason cannot brook it.\n\nXVIII. Nature hath its end as well in the end and final consummation of anything that is, as in the beginnine and continuation of it.\n\nXIX. As one that tosseth up a ball. And what is a. ball the better, if the motion of it be upwards; or the worse if it be downwards; or if it chance to fall upon the ground? So for the bubble; if it continue, what it the better? and if it dissolve, what is it the worse And so is it of a candle too. And so must thou reason with thyself, both in matter of fame, and in matter of death. For as for the body itself, (the subject of death) wouldest thou know the vileness of it ? Turn it about that thou mayest behold it the worst sides upwards as well, as in its more ordinary pleasant shape; how doth it look, when it is old and withered? when sick and pained? when in the act of lust, and fornication? And as for fame. This life is short. Both he that praiseth, and he that is praised; he that remembers, and he that is remembered, will soon be dust and ashes. Besides, it is but in one corner of this part of the world that thou art praised; and yet in this corner, thou hast not the joint praises of all men; no nor scarce of any one constantly. And yet the whole earth itself, what is it but as one point, in regard of the whole world?\n\nXX. That which must be the subject of thy consideration, is either the matter itself, or the dogma, or the operation, or the true sense and signification.\n\nXXI. Most justly have these things happened unto thee: why dost not thou amend? O but thou hadst rather become good to-morrow, than to be so to-day.\n\nXXII. Shall I do it? I will; so the end of my action be to do good unto men. Doth anything by way of cross or adversity happen unto me? I accept it, with reference unto the Gods, and their providence; the fountain of all things, from which whatsoever comes to pass, doth hang and depend.\n\nXXIII. By one action judge of the rest: this bathing which usually takes up so much of our time, what is it? Oil, sweat, filth; or the sordes of the body: an excrementitious viscosity, the excrements of oil and other ointments used about the body, and mixed with the sordes of the body: all base and loathsome. And such almost is every part of our life; and every worldly object.\n\nXXIV. Lucilla buried Verus; then was Lucilla herself buried by others. So Secunda Maximus, then Secunda herself. So Epitynchanus, Diotimus; then Epitynchanus himself. So Antoninus Pius, Faustina his wife; then Antoninus himself. This is the course of the world. First Celer, Adrianus; then Adrianus himself. And those austere ones; those that foretold other men's deaths; those that were so proud and stately, where are they now? Those austere ones I mean, such as were Charax, and Demetrius the Platonic, and Eudaemon, and others like unto those. They were all but for one day; all dead and gone long since. Some of them no sooner dead, than forgotten. Others soon turned into fables. Of others, even that which was fabulous, is now long since forgotten. This thereafter thou must remember, that whatsoever thou art compounded of, shall soon be dispersed, and that thy life and breath, or thy soul, shall either he no more or shall ranslated, and appointed to some certain place and station.\n\nXXV. The true joy of a man, is to do that which properly belongs unto a man. That which is most proper unto a man, is, first, to he kindly affected towards them that are of the same kind and nature as he is himself to contemn all sensual motions and appetites, to discern rightly all plausible fancies and imaginations, to contemplate the nature of the universe; both it, and things that are done in it. In which kind of con templation three several relations are to be observed The first, to the apparent secondary cause. The Second to the first original cause, God, from whom originally proceeds whatsoever doth happen in the world. The third and last, to them that we live and converse with: what use may be made of it, to their use and benefit\n\nXXVI. If pain be an evil, either it is in regard of the body; (and that cannot be, because the body of itself is altogether insensible:) or in regard of the soul But it is in the power of the soul, to preserve her own peace and tranquillity, and not to suppose that pain is evil. For all judgment and deliberation; all prosecution, or aversation is from within, whither the sense of evil (except it be let in by opinion) cannot penetrate.\n\nXXVII. Wipe off all idle fancies, and say unto thyselF incessantly; Now if I will, it is in my power to keep out of this my soul all wickedness, all lust, and concupiscences, all trouble and confusion. But on the contrary to behold and consider all things according to their true nature, and to carry myself towards everything according to its true worth. Remember then this thy power that nature hath given thee.\n\nXXVIII. Whether thou speak in the Senate or whether thou speak to any particular, let thy speech In always grave and modest. But thou must not openly and vulgarly observe that sound and exact form of speaking, concerning that which is truly good and truly civil; the vanity of the world, and of worldly men: which otherwise truth and reason doth prescribe.\n\nXXIX. Augustus his court; his wife, his daughter, his nephews, his sons-in-law his sister, Agrippa, his kinsmen, his domestics, his friends; Areus, Maecenas, his slayers of beasts for sacrifice and divination: there thou hast the death of a whole court together. Proceed now on to the rest that have been since that of Augustus. Hath death dwelt with them otherwise, though so many and so stately whilst they lived, than it doth use to deal with any one particular man? Consider now the death of a whole kindred and family, as of that of the Pompeys, as that also that useth to be written upon some monuments, HE WASS THE LAST OF HIS OWN KINDRED. O what care did his predecessors take, that they might leave a successor, yet behold at last one or other must of necessity be THE LAST. Here again therefore consider the death of a whole kindred.\n\nXXX. Contract thy whole life to the measure and proportion of one single action. And if in every particular action thou dost perform what is fitting to the utmost of thy power, let it suffice thee. And who can hinder thee, but that thou mayest perform what is fitting? But there may be some outward let and impediment. Not any, that can hinder thee, but that whatsoever thou dost, thou may do it, justly, temperately, and with the praise of God. Yea, but there may be somewhat, whereby some operation or other of thine may he hindered. And then, with that very thing that doth hinder, thou mayest he well pleased, and so by this gentle and equanimious conversion of thy mind unto that which may be, instead of that which at first thou didst intend, in the room of that former action there succeedeth another, which agrees as well with this contraction of thy life, that we now speak of.\n\nXXXI. Receive temporal blessings without ostentation, when they are sent and thou shalt be able to part with them with all readiness and facility when they are taken from thee again.\n\nXXXII. If ever thou sawest either a hand, or a foot, or a head lying by itself, in some place or other, as cut off from the rest of the body, such must thou conceive him to make himself, as much as in him lieth, that either is offended with anything that is happened, (whatsoever it be) and as it were divides himself from it: or that commits anything against the natural law of mutual correspondence, and society among men: or, he that, commits any act of uncharitableness. Whosoever thou art, thou art such, thou art cast forth I know not whither out of the general unity, which is according to nature. Thou went born indeed a part, but now thou hast cut thyself off. However, herein is matter of joy and exultation, that thou mayst be united again. God bath not granted it unto any other part, that once separated and cut off, it might be reunited, and come together again. But, behold, that GOODNESS how great and immense it is! which hath so much esteemed MAN. As at first be was so made, that he needed not, except he would himself, have divided himself from the whole; so once divided and cut off, IT hath so provided and ordered it, that if he would himself, he might return, and grow together again, and be admitted into its former rank and place of a part, as he was before.\n\nXXXIII. As almost all her other faculties and properties the nature of the universe bath imparted unto every reasonable creature, so this in particular we have received from her, that as whatsoever doth oppose itself unto her, and doth withstand her in her purposes and intentions, she doth, though against its will and intention, bring it about to herself, to serve herself of it in the execution of her own destinated ends; and so by this though not intended co-operation of it with herself makes it part of herself whether it will or no. So may every reasonable creature, what crosses and impediments soever it meets with in the course of this mortal life, it may use them as fit and proper objects, to the furtherance of whatsoever it intended and absolutely proposed unto itself as its natural end and happiness.\n\nXXXIV. Let not the general representation unto thyself of the wretchedness of this our mortal life, trouble thee. Let not thy mind wander up and down, and heap together in her thoughts the many troubles and grievous calamities which thou art as subject unto as any other. But as everything in particular doth happen, put this question unto thyself, and say: What is it that in this present matter, seems unto thee so intolerable? For thou wilt be ashamed to confess it. Then upon this presently call to mind, that neither that which is future, nor that which is past can hurt thee; but that only which is present. (And that also is much lessened, if thou dost lightly circumscribe it:) and then check thy mind if for so little a while, (a mere instant), it cannot hold out with patience.\n\nXXXV. What? are either Panthea or Pergamus abiding to this day by their masters' tombs? or either Chabrias or Diotimus by that of Adrianus? O foolery! For what if they did, would their masters be sensible of It? or if sensible, would they be glad of it? or if glad, were these immortal? Was not it appointed unto them also (both men and women,) to become old in time, and then to die? And these once dead, what would become of these former? And when all is done, what is all this for, but for a mere bag of blood and corruption?\n\nXXXVI. If thou beest quick-sighted, be so in matter of judgment, and best discretion, saith he.\n\nXXXVII. In the whole constitution of man, I see not any virtue contrary to justice, whereby it may be resisted and opposed. But one whereby pleasure and voluptuousness may be resisted and opposed, I see: continence.\n\nXXXVIII. If thou canst but withdraw conceit and opinion concerning that which may seem hurtful and offensive, thou thyself art as safe, as safe may be. Thou thyself? and who is that? Thy reason. 'Yea, but I am not reason.' Well, be it so. However, let not thy reason or understanding admit of grief, and if there be anything in thee that is grieved, let that, (whatsoever it be,) conceive its own grief, if it can.\n\nXXXIX. That which is a hindrance of the senses, is an evil to the sensitive nature. That which is a hindrance of the appetitive and prosecutive faculty, is an evil to the sensitive nature. As of the sensitive, so of the vegetative constitution, whatsoever is a hindrance unto it, is also in that respect an evil unto the same. And so likewise, whatsoever is a hindrance unto the mind and understanding, must needs be the proper evil of the reasonable nature. Now apply all those things unto thyself. Do either pain or pleasure seize on thee? Let the senses look to that. Hast thou met with Some obstacle or other in thy purpose and intention? If thou didst propose without due reservation and exception now hath thy reasonable part received a blow indeed But if in general thou didst propose unto thyself what soever might be, thou art not thereby either hurt, nor properly hindered. For in those things that properly belong unto the mind, she cannot be hindered by any man. It is not fire, nor iron; nor the power of a tyrant nor the power of a slandering tongue; nor anything else that can penetrate into her.\n\nXL. If once round and solid, there is no fear that ever it will change.\n\nXLI. Why should I grieve myself; who never did willingly grieve any other! One thing rejoices one and another thing another. As for me, this is my joy , if my understanding be right and sound, as neither averse from any man, nor refusing any of those things which as a man I am) subject unto; if I can look upon all things in the world meekly and kindly; accept all things and carry myself towards everything according to to true worth of the thing itself.\n\nXLII. This time that is now present, bestow thou upon thyself. They that rather hunt for fame after death, do not consider, that those men that shall be hereafter, will be even such, as these whom now they can so hardly bear with. And besides they also will be mortal men. But to consider the thing in itself, if so many with so many voices, shall make such and such a sound, or shall have such and such an opinion concerning thee, what is it to thee?\n\nXLIII. Take me and throw me where thou wilt: I am indifferent. For there also I shall have that spirit which is within me propitious; that is well pleased and fully contented both in that constant disposition, and with those particular actions, which to its own proper constitution are suitable and agreeable.\n\nXLIV. Is this then a thing of that worth, that for it my soul should suffer, and become worse than it was? as either basely dejected, or disordinately affected, or confounded within itself, or terrified? What can there be, that thou shouldest so much esteem?\n\nXLV. Nothing can happen unto thee, which is not incidental unto thee, as thou art a man. As nothing can happen either to an ox, a vine, or to a stone, which is not incidental unto them; unto every one in his own kind. If therefore nothing can happen unto anything, which is not both usual and natural; why art thou displeased? Sure the common nature of all would not bring anything upon any, that were intolerable. If therefore it be a thing external that causes thy grief, know, that it is not that properly that doth cause it, but thine own conceit and opinion concerning the thing: which thou mayest rid thyself of, when thou wilt. But if it be somewhat that is amiss in thine own disposition, that doth grieve thee, mayest thou not rectify thy moral tenets and opinions. But if it grieve thee, that thou doest not perform that which seemeth unto thee right and just, why doest not thou choose rather to perform it than to grieve? But somewhat that is stronger than thyself doth hinder thee. Let it not grieve thee then, if it be not thy fault that the thing is not performed. 'Yea but it is a thing of that nature, as that thy life is not worth the while, except it may be performed.' If it be so, upon condition that thou be kindly and lovingly disposed towards all men, thou mayest be gone. For even then, as much as at any time, art thou in a very good estate of performance, when thou doest die in charity with those, that are an obstacle unto thy performance.\n\nXLVI. Remember that thy mind is of that nature as that it becometh altogether unconquerable, when once recollected in herself, she seeks no other content than this, that she cannot be forced: yea though it so fall out, that it be even against reason itself, that it cloth bandy. How much less when by the help of reason she is able to judge of things with discretion? And therefore let thy chief fort and place of defence be, a mind free from passions. A stronger place, (whereunto to make his refuge, and so to bccome impregnable) and better fortified than this, bath no man. He that seeth not this is unlearned. He that seeth it, and betaketh not himself to this place of refuge, is unhappy.\n\nXLVII. Keep thyself to the first bare and naked apprehensions of things, as they present themselves unto thee, and add not unto them. It is reported unto thee, that such a one speaketh ill of thee. Well; that he speaketh ill of thee, so much is reported. But that thou art hurt thereby, is not reported: that is the addition of opinion, which thou must exclude. I see that my child is sick. That he is sick, I see, but that he is in danger of his life also, I see it not. Thus thou must use to keep thyself to the first motions and apprehensions of things, as they present themselves outwardly; and add not unto them from within thyself through mere conceit and opinion. Or rather add unto them: hut as one that understandeth the true nature of all things that happen in the world.\n\nXLVIII. Is the cucumber bitter? set it away. Brambles are in the way? avoid them. Let this suffice. Add not presently speaking unto thyself, What serve these things for in the world? For, this, one that is acquainted with the mysteries of nature, will laugh at thee for it; as a carpenter would or a shoemaker, if meeting in either of their shops with some shavings, or small remnants of their work, thou shouldest blame them for it. And yet those men, it is not for want of a place where to throw them that they keep them in their shops for a while: but the nature of the universe hath no such out-place; but herein doth consist the wonder of her art and skill, that she having once circumscribed herself within some certain bounds and limits, whatsoever is within her that seems either corrupted, or old, or unprofitable, she can change it into herself, and of these very things can make new things; so that she needeth not to seek elsewhere out of herself either for a new supply of matter and substance, or for a place where to throw out whatsoever is irrecoverably putrid and corrupt. Thus she, as for place, so for matter and art, is herself sufficient unto herself.\n\nXLIX. Not to be slack and negligent; or loose, and wanton in thy actions; nor contentious, and troublesome in thy conversation; nor to rove and wander in thy fancies and imaginations. Not basely to contract thy soul; nor boisterously to sally out with it, or furiously to launch out as it were, nor ever to want employment.\n\nL. 'They kill me, they cut- my flesh; they persecute my person with curses.' What then? May not thy mind for all this continue pure, prudent, temperate, just? As a fountain of sweet and clear water, though she be cursed by some stander by, yet do her springs nevertheless still run as sweet and clear as before; yea though either dirt or dung be thrown in, yet is it no sooner thrown, than dispersed, and she cleared. She cannot be dyed or infected by it. What then must I do, that I may have within myself an overflowing fountain, and not a well? Beget thyself by continual pains and endeavours to true liberty with charity, and true simplicity and modesty.\n\nLI. He that knoweth not what the world is, knoweth not where he himself is. And he that knoweth not what the world was made for, cannot possibly know either what are the qualities, or what is the nature of the world. Now he that in either of these is to seek, for what he himself was made is ignorant also. What then dost thou think of that man, who proposeth unto himself, as a matter of great moment, the noise and applause of men, who both where they are, and what they are themselves, are altogether ignorant? Dost thou desire to be commended of that man, who thrice in one hour perchance, doth himself curse himself? Dost thou desire to please him, who pleaseth not himself? or dost thou think that he pleaseth himself, who doth use to repent himself almost of everything that he doth?\n\nLII. Not only now henceforth to have a common. breath, or to hold correspondency of breath, with that air, that compasseth us about; but to have a common mind, or to hold correspondency of mind also with that rational substance, which compasseth all things. For, that also is of itself, and of its own nature (if a man can but draw it in as he should) everywhere diffused; and passeth through all things, no less than the air doth, if a man can but suck it in.\n\nLIII. Wickedness in general doth not hurt the world. Particular wickedness doth not hurt any other: only unto him it is hurtful, whosoever he be that offends, unto whom in great favour and mercy it is granted, that whensoever he himself shall but first desire it, he may be presently delivered of it. Unto my free-will my neighbour's free-will, whoever he be, (as his life, or his bode), is altogether indifferent. For though we are all made one for another, yet have our minds and understandings each of them their own proper and limited jurisdiction. For else another man's wickedness might be my evil which God would not have, that it might not be in another man's power to make me unhappy: which nothing now can do but mine own wickedness.\n\nLIV. The sun seemeth to be shed abroad. And indeed it is diffused but not effused. For that diffusion of it is a τάσις or an extension. For therefore are the beams of it called  ακτίνες from the word εκτείνεσθα, to be stretched out and extended. Now what a sunbeam is, thou mayest know if thou observe the light of the sun, when through some narrow hole it pierceth into some room that is dark. For it is always in a direct line. And as by any solid body, that it meets with in the way that is not penetrable by air, it is divided and abrupted, and yet neither slides off, or falls down, but stayeth there nevertheless: such must the diffusion in the mind be; not an effusion, but an extension. What obstacles and impediments soever she meeteth within her way, she must not violently, and by way of an impetuous onset light upon them; neither must she fall down; but she must stand, and give light unto that which doth admit of it. For as for that which doth not, it is its own fault and loss, if it bereave itself of her light.\n\nLV. He that feareth death, either feareth that he shall have no sense at all, or that his senses will not be the same. Whereas, he should rather comfort himself, that either no sense at all, and so no sense of evil; or if any sense, then another life, and so no death properly.\n\nLVI. All men are made one for another: either then teach them better, or bear with them.\n\nLVII. The motion of the mind is not as the motion of a dart. For the mind when it is wary and cautelous, and by way of diligent circumspection turneth herself many ways, may then as well be said to go straight on to the object, as when it useth no such circumspection.\n\nLVIII. To pierce and penetrate into the estate of every one's understanding that thou hast to do with: as also to make the estate of thine own open, and penetrable to any other.\n\n\n\nTHE NINTH BOOK\n\n\nI. He that is unjust, is also impious. For the nature of the universe, having made all reasonable creatures one for another, to the end that they should do one another good; more or less according to the several persons and occasions but in nowise hurt one another: it is manifest that he that doth transgress against this her will, is guilty of impiety towards the most ancient and venerable of all the deities. For the nature of the universe, is the nature the common parent of all, and therefore piously to be observed of all things that are, and that which now is, to whatsoever first was, and gave it its being, hath relation of blood and kindred. She is also called truth and is the first cause of all truths. He therefore that willingly and wittingly doth lie, is impious in that he doth receive, and so commit injustice: but he that against his will, in that he disagreeth from the nature of the universe, and in that striving with the nature of the world he doth in his particular, violate the general order of the world. For he doth no better than strive and war against it, who contrary to his own nature applieth himself to that which is contrary to truth. For nature had before furnished him with instincts and opportunities sufficient for the attainment of it ; which he having hitherto neglected, is not now able to discern that which is false from that which is true. He also that pursues after pleasures, as that which is truly good and flies from pains, as that which is truly evil: is impious. For such a one must of necessity oftentimes accuse that common nature, as distributing many things both unto the evil, and unto the good, not according to the deserts of either: as unto the bad oftentimes pleasures, and the causes of pleasures; so unto the good, pains, and the occasions of pains. Again, he that feareth pains and crosses in this world, feareth some of those things which some time or other must needs happen in the world. And that we have already showed to be impious. And he that pursueth after pleasures, will not spare, to compass his desires, to do that which is unjust, and that is manifestly impious. Now those things which unto nature are equally indifferent (for she had not created both, both pain and pleasure, if both had not been unto her equally indifferent): they that will live according to nature, must in those things (as being of the same mind and disposition that she is) be as equally indifferent. Whosoever therefore in either matter of pleasure and pain; death and life; honour and dishonour, (which things nature in the administration of the world, indifferently doth make use of), is not as indifferent, it is apparent that he is impious. When I say that common nature doth indifferently make use of them, my meaning is, that they happen indifferently in the ordinary course of things, which by a necessary consequence, whether as principal or accessory, come to pass in the world, according to that first and ancient deliberation of Providence, by which she from some certain beginning, did resolve upon the creation of such a world, conceiving then in her womb as it were some certain rational generative seeds and faculties of things future, whether subjects, changes, successions; both such and such, and just so many.\n\nII. It were indeed more happy and comfortable, for a man to depart out of this world, having lived all his life long clear from all falsehood, dissimulation, voluptuousness, and pride. But if this cannot be, yet it is some comfort for a man joyfully to depart as weary, and out of love with those; rather than to desire to live, and to continue long in those wicked courses. Hath not yet experience taught thee to fly from the plague? For a far greater plague is the corruption of the mind, than any certain change and distemper of the common air can be. This is a plague of creatures, as they are living creatures; but that of men as they are men or reasonable.\n\nIII. Thou must not in matter of death carry thyself scornfully, but as one that is well pleased with it, as being one of those things that nature hath appointed. For what thou dost conceive of these, of a boy to become a young man, to wax old, to grow, to ripen, to get teeth, or a beard, or grey hairs to beget, to bear, or to be delivered; or what other action soever it be, that is natural unto man according to the several seasons of his life; such a thing is it also to he dissolved. It is therefore the part of a wise man, in matter of death, not in any wise to carry himself either violently, or proudly but patiently to wait for it, as one of nature's operations: that with the same mind as now thou dost expect when that which yet is but an embryo in thy wife's belly shall come forth, thou mayst expect also when thy soul shall fall off from that outward coat or skin: wherein as a child in the belly it lieth involved and shut up. But thou desirest a more popular, and though not so direct and philosophical, yet a very powerful and penetrative recipe against the fear of death, nothing can make they more willing to part with thy life, than if thou shalt consider, both what the subjects themselves are that thou shalt part with, and what manner of disposition thou shalt no more have to do with. True it is, that. offended with them thou must not be by no means, but take care of them, and meekly bear with them However, this thou mayst remember, that whensoever it happens that thou depart, it shall not be from men that held the same opinions that thou dost. For that indeed, (if it were so) is the only thing that might make thee averse from death, and willing to continue here, if it were thy hap to live with men that had obtained the same belief that thou hast. But now, what a toil it is for thee to live with men of different opinions, thou seest: so that thou hast rather occasion to say, Hasten, I thee pray, O Death; lest I also in time forget myself.\n\nIV. He that sinneth, sinneth unto himself. He that is unjust, hurts himself, in that he makes himself worse than he was before. Not he only that committeth, but he also that omitteth something, is oftentimes unjust.\n\nV. If my present apprehension of the object be right, and my present action charitable, and this, towards whatsoever doth proceed from God, be my present disposition, to be well pleased with it, it sufficeth.\n\nVI. To wipe away fancy, to use deliberation, to quench concupiscence, to keep the mind free to herself.\n\nVII. Of all unreasonable creatures, there is but one unreasonable soul; and of all that are reasonable, but one reasonable soul, divided betwixt them all. As of all earthly things there is but one earth, and but one light that we see by; and but one air that we breathe in, as many as either breathe or see. Now whatsoever partakes of some common thing, naturally affects and inclines unto that whereof it is part, being of one kind and nature with it. Whatsoever is earthly, presseth downwards to the common earth. Whatsoever is liquid, would flow together. And whatsoever is airy, would be together likewise. So that without some obstacle, and some kind of violence, they cannot well be kept asunder. Whatsoever is fiery, doth not only by reason of the elementary fire tend upwards; but here also is so ready to join, and to burn together, that whatsoever doth want sufficient moisture to make resistance, is easily set on fire. Whatsoever therefore is partaker of that reasonable common nature, naturally doth as much and more long after his own kind. For by how much in its own nature it excels all other things, by so much more is it desirous to be joined and united unto that, which is of its own nature. As for unreasonable creatures then, they had not long been, but presently begun among them swarms, and flocks, and broods of young ones, and a kind of mutual love and affection. For though but unreasonable, yet a kind of soul these had, and therefore was that natural desire of union more strong and intense in them, as in creatures of a more excellent nature, than either in plants, or stones, or trees. But among reasonable creatures, begun commonwealths, friendships, families, public meetings, and even in their wars, conventions, and truces. Now among them that were yet of a more excellent nature, as the stars and planets, though by their nature far distant one from another, yet even among them began some mutual correspondency and unity. So proper is it to excellency in a high degree to affect unity, as that even in things so far distant, it could operate unto a mutual sympathy. But now behold, what is now come to pass. Those creatures that are reasonable, are now the only creatures that have forgotten their natural affection and inclination of one towards another. Among them alone of all other things that are of one kind, there is not to be found a general disposition to flow together. But though they fly from nature, yet are they stopt in their course, and apprehended. Do they what they can, nature doth prevail. And so shalt thou confess, if thou dost observe it. For sooner mayst thou find a thing earthly, where no earthly thing is, than find a man that naturally can live by himself alone.\n\nVIII. Man, God, the world, every one in their kind, bear some fruits. All things have their proper time to bear. Though by custom, the word itself is in a manner become proper unto the vine, and the like, yet is it so nevertheless, as we have said. As for reason, that beareth both common fruit for the use of others; and peculiar, which itself doth enjoy. Reason is of a diffusive nature, what itself is in itself, it begets in others, and so doth multiply.\n\nIX. Either teach them better if it be in thy power; or if it be not, remember that for this use, to bear with them patiently, was mildness and goodness granted unto thee. The Gods themselves are good unto such; yea and in some things, (as in matter of health, of wealth, of honour,) are content often to further their endeavours: so good and gracious are they. And mightest thou not be so too? or, tell me, what doth hinder thee?\n\nX. Labour not as one to whom it is appointed to be wretched, nor as one that either would be pitied, or admired; but let this be thine only care and desire; so always and in all things to prosecute or to forbear, as the law of charity, or mutual society doth require.\n\nXI. This day I did come out of all my trouble. Nay I have cast out all my trouble; it should rather be for that which troubled thee, whatsoever it was, was not without anywhere that thou shouldest come out of it, but within in thine own opinions, from whence it must be cast out, before thou canst truly and constantly be at ease.\n\nXII. All those things, for matter of experience are usual and ordinary; for their continuance but for a day; and for their matter, most base and filthy. As they were in the days of those whom we have buried, so are they now also, and no otherwise.\n\nXIII. The things themselves that affect us, they stand without doors, neither knowing anything themselves nor able to utter anything unto others concerning themselves. What then is it, that passeth verdict on them? The understanding\n\nXIV. As virtue and wickedness consist not in passion, but in action; so neither doth the true good or evil of a reasonable charitable man consist in passion, but in operation and action.\n\nXV. To the stone that is cast up, when it comes down it is no hurt unto it; as neither benefit, when it doth ascend.\n\nXVI. Sift their minds and understandings, and behold what men they be, whom thou dost stand in fear of what they shall judge of thee, what they themselves judge of themselves.\n\nXVII. All things that are in the world, are always in the estate of alteration. Thou also art in a perpetual change, yea and under corruption too, in some part: and so is the whole world.\n\nXVIII. it is not thine, but another man's sin. Why should it trouble thee? Let him look to it, whose sin it is.\n\nXIX. Of an operation and of a purpose there is an ending, or of an action and of a purpose we say commonly, that it is at an end: from opinion also there is an absolute cessation, which is as it were the death of it. In all this there is no hurt. Apply this now to a man's age, as first, a child; then a youth, then a young man, then an old man; every change from one age to another is a kind of death And all this while here no matter of grief yet. Pass now unto that life first, that which thou livedst under thy grandfather, then under thy mother, then under thy father. And thus when through the whole course of thy life hitherto thou hast found and observed many alterations, many changes, many kinds of endings and cessations, put this question to thyself What matter of grief or sorrow dost thou find in any of these? Or what doest thou suffer through any of these? If in none of these, then neither in the ending and consummation of thy whole life, which is also but a cessation and change.\n\nXX. As occasion shall require, either to thine own understanding, or to that of the universe, or to his, whom thou hast now to do with, let thy refuge be with all speed. To thine own, that it resolve upon nothing against justice. To that of the universe, that thou mayest remember, part of whom thou art. Of his, that thou mayest consider. whether in the estate of ignorance, or of knowledge. And then also must thou call to mind, that he is thy kinsman.\n\nXXI. As thou thyself, whoever thou art, were made for the perfection and consummation, being a member of it, of a common society; so must every action of thine tend to the perfection and consummation of a life that is truly sociable. What action soever of thine therefore that either immediately or afar off, hath not reference to the common good, that is an exorbitant and disorderly action; yea it is seditious; as one among the people who from such and such a consent and unity, should factiously divide and separate himself.\n\nXXII. Children's anger, mere babels; wretched souls bearing up dead bodies, that they may not have their fall so soon: even as it is in that common dirge song.\n\nXXIII. Go to the quality of the cause from which the effect doth proceed. Behold it by itself bare and naked, separated from all that is material. Then consider the utmost bounds of time that that cause, thus and thus qualified, can subsist and abide.\n\nXXIV. Infinite are the troubles and miseries, that thou hast already been put to, by reason of this only, because that for all happiness it did not suffice thee, or, that thou didst not account it sufficient happiness, that thy understanding did operate according to its natural constitution.\n\nXXV. When any shall either impeach thee with false accusations, or hatefully reproach thee, or shall use any such carriage towards thee, get thee presently to their minds and understandings, and look in them, and behold what manner of men they be. Thou shalt see, that there is no such occasion why it should trouble thee, what such as they are think of thee. Yet must thou love them still, for by nature they are thy friends. And the Gods themselves, in those things that they seek from them as matters of great moment, are well content, all manner of ways, as by dreams and oracles, to help them as well as others.\n\nXXVI. Up and down, from one age to another, go the ordinary things of the world; being still the same. And either of everything in particular before it come to pass, the mind of the universe doth consider with itself and deliberate: and if so, then submit for shame unto the determination of such an excellent understanding: or once for all it did resolve upon all things in general; and since that whatsoever happens, happens by a necessary consequence, and all things indivisibly in a manner and inseparably hold one of another. In sum, either there is a God, and then all is well; or if all things go by chance and fortune, yet mayest thou use thine own providence in those things that concern thee properly; and then art thou well.\n\nXXVII. Within a while the earth shall cover us all, and then she herself shall have her change. And then the course will be, from one period of eternity unto another, and so a perpetual eternity. Now can any man that shall consider with himself in his mind the several rollings or successions of so many changes and alterations, and the swiftness of all these rulings; can he otherwise but contemn in his heart and despise all worldly things? The cause of the universe is as it were a strong torrent, it carrieth all away.\n\nXXVIII. And these your professed politicians, the only true practical philosophers of the world, (as they think of themselves) so full of affected gravity, or such professed lovers of virtue and honesty, what wretches be they in very deed; how vile and contemptible in themselves? O man! what ado doest thou keep? Do what thy nature doth now require. Resolve upon it, if thou mayest: and take no thought, whether anybody shall know it or no. Yea, but sayest thou, I must not expect a Plato's commonwealth. If they profit though never so little, I must be content; and think much even of that little progress. Doth then any of them forsake their former false opinions that I should think they profit? For without a change of opinions, alas! what is all that ostentation, but mere wretchedness of slavish. minds, that groan privately, and yet would make a show of obedience to reason, and truth? Go too now and tell me of Alexander and Philippus, and Demetrius Phalereus. Whether they understood what the common nature requireth, and could rule themselves or no, they know best themselves. But if they kept a life, and swaggered; I (God be thanked) am not bound to imitate them. The effect of true philosophy is, unaffected simplicity and modesty. Persuade me not to ostentation and vainglory.\n\nXXIX. From some high place as it were to look down, and to behold here flocks, and there sacrifices, without number; and all kind of navigation; some in a rough and stormy sea, and some in a calm: the general differences, or different estates of things, some, that are now first upon being; the several and mutual relations of those things that are together; and some other things that are at their last. Their lives also, who were long ago, and theirs who shall be hereafter, and the present estate and life of those many nations of barbarians that are now in the world, thou must likewise consider in thy mind. And how many there be, who never so much as heard of thy name, how many that will soon forget it; how many who but even now did commend thee, within a very little while perchance will speak ill of tbee. So that neither fame, nor honour, nor anything else that this world doth afford, is worth the while. The sum then of all; whatsoever doth happen unto thee, whereof God is the cause, to accept it contentedly: whatsoever thou doest, whereof thou thyself art the cause, to do it justly: which will be, if both in thy resolution and in thy action thou have no further end, than to do good unto others, as being that, which by thy natural constitution, as a man, thou art bound unto.\n\nXXX. Many of those things that trouble and straiten thee, it is in thy power to cut off, as wholly depending from mere conceit and opinion; and then thou shalt have room enough.\n\nXXXI. To comprehend the whole world together in thy mind, and the whole course of this present age to represent it unto thyself, and to fix thy thoughts upon the sudden change of every particular object. How short the time is from the generation of anything, unto the dissolution of the same; but how immense and infinite both that which was before the generation, and that which after the generation of it shall be. All things that thou seest, will soon be perished, and they that see their corruptions, will soon vanish away themselves. He that dieth a hundred years old, and he that dieth young, shall come all to one.\n\nXXXII. What are their minds and understandings; and what the things that they apply themselves unto: what do they love, and what do they hate for? Fancy to thyself the estate of their souls openly to be seen. When they think they hurt them shrewdly, whom they speak ill of; and when they think they do them a very good turn, whom they commend and extol: O how full are they then of conceit, and opinion!\n\nXXXIII. Loss and corruption, is in very deed nothing else but change and alteration; and that is it, which the nature of the universe doth most delight in, by which, and according to which, whatsoever is done, is well done. For that was the estate of worldly things from the beginning, and so shall it ever be. Or wouldest. thou rather say, that all things in the world have gone ill from the beginning for so many ages, and shall ever go ill? And then among so many deities, could no divine power be found all this while, that could rectify the things of the world? Or is the world, to incessant woes and miseries, for ever condemned?\n\nXXXIV. How base and putrid, every common matter is! Water, dust, and from the mixture of these bones, and all that loathsome stuff that our bodies do consist of: so subject to be infected, and corrupted. And again those other things that are so much prized and admired, as marble stones, what are they, but as it were the kernels of the earth ? gold and silver, what are they, but as the more gross faeces of the earth? Thy most royal apparel, for matter, it is but as it were the hair of a silly sheep, and for colour, the very blood of a shell-fish; of this nature are all other things. Thy life itself, is some such thing too; a mere exhalation of blood: and it also, apt to be changed into some other common thing.\n\nXXXV. Will this querulousness, this murmuring, this complaining and dissembling never be at an end? What then is it, that troubleth thee? Doth any new thing happen unto thee? What doest thou so wonder at? At the cause, or the matter? Behold either by itself, is either of that weight and moment indeed? And besides these, there is not anything. But thy duty towards the Gods also, it is time thou shouldst acquit thyself of it with more goodness and simplicity.\n\nXXXVI. It is all one to see these things for a hundred of years together or but for three years.\n\nXXXVII. If he have sinned, his is the harm, not mine. But perchance he hath not.\n\nXXXVIII. Either all things by the providence of reason happen unto every particular, as a part of one general body ; and then it is against reason that a part should complain of anything that happens for the good of the whole; or if, according to Epicurus, atoms be the cause of all things and that life be nothing else but an accidentary confusion of things, and death nothing else, but a mere dispersion and so of all other things: what doest thou trouble thyself for?\n\nXXXIX. Sayest thou unto that rational part, Thou art dead; corruption hath taken hold on thee? Doth it then also void excrements? Doth it like either oxen, or sheep, graze or feed; that it also should be mortal, as well as the body?\n\nXL. Either the Gods can do nothing for us at all, or they can still and allay all the distractions and distempers of thy mind. If they can do nothing, why doest thou pray? If they can, why wouldst not thou rather pray, that they will grant unto thee, that thou mayst neither fear, nor lust after any of those worldly things which cause these distractions and distempers of it? Why not rather, that thou mayst not at either their absence or presence, be grieved and discontented: than either that thou mayst obtain them, or that thou mayst avoid them? For certainly it must needs be, that if the Gods can help us in anything, they may in this kind also. But thou wilt say perchance, 'In those things the Gods have given me my liberty: and it is in mine own power to do what I will.' But if thou mayst use this liberty, rather to set thy mind at true liberty, than wilfully with baseness and servility of mind to affect those things, which either to compass or to avoid is not in thy power, wert not thou better? And as for the Gods, who hath told thee, that they may not help us up even in those things that they have put in our own power? whether it be so or no, thou shalt soon perceive, if thou wilt but try thyself and pray. One prayeth that he may compass his desire, to lie with such or such a one, pray thou that thou mayst not lust to lie with her. Another how he may be rid of such a one; pray thou that thou mayst so patiently bear with him, as that thou have no such need to be rid of him. Another, that he may not lose his child. Pray thou that thou mayst not fear to lose him. To this end and purpose, let all thy prayer be, and see what will be the event.\n\nXLI. 'In my sickness' (saith Epicurus of himself:) 'my discourses were not concerning the nature of my disease, neither was that, to them that came to visit me, the subject of my talk; but in the consideration and contemplation of that, which was of especial weight and moment, was all my time bestowed and spent, and among others in this very thing, how my mind, by a natural and unavoidable sympathy partaking in some sort with the present indisposition of my body, might nevertheless keep herself free from trouble, and in present possession of her own proper happiness. Neither did I leave the ordering of my body to the physicians altogether to do with me what they would, as though I expected any great matter from them, or as though I thought it a matter of such great consequence, by their means to recover my health: for my present estate, methought, liked me very well, and gave me good content.' Whether therefore in sickness (if thou chance to sicken) or in what other kind of extremity soever, endeavour thou also to be in thy mind so affected, as he doth report of himself: not to depart from thy philosophy for anything that can befall thee, nor to give ear to the discourses of silly people, and mere naturalists.\n\nXLII. It is common to all trades and professions to mind and intend that only, which now they are about, and the instrument whereby they work.\n\nXLIII. When at any time thou art offended with any one's impudency, put presently this question to thyself: 'What? Is it then possible, that there should not be any impudent men in the world! Certainly it is not possible.' Desire not then that which is impossible. For this one, (thou must think) whosoever he be, is one of those impudent ones, that the world cannot be without. So of the subtile and crafty, so of the perfidious, so of every one that offendeth, must thou ever be ready to reason with thyself. For whilst in general thou dost thus reason with thyself, that the kind of them must needs be in the world, thou wilt be the better able to use meekness towards every particular. This also thou shalt find of very good use, upon every such occasion, presently to consider with thyself, what proper virtue nature hath furnished man with, against such a vice, or to encounter with a disposition vicious in this kind. As for example, against the unthankful, it hath given goodness and meekness, as an antidote, and so against another vicious in another kind some other peculiar faculty. And generally, is it not in thy power to instruct him better, that is in an error? For whosoever sinneth, doth in that decline from his purposed end, and is certainly deceived, And again, what art thou the worse for his sin? For thou shalt not find that any one of these, against whom thou art incensed, hath in very deed done anything whereby thy mind (the only true subject of thy hurt and evil) can be made worse than it was. And what a matter of either grief or wonder is this, if he that is unlearned, do the deeds of one that is unlearned? Should not thou rather blame thyself, who, when upon very good grounds of reason, thou mightst have thought it very probable, that such a thing would by such a one be committed, didst not only not foresee it, but moreover dost wonder at it, that such a thing should be. But then especially, when thou dost find fault with either an unthankful, or a false man, must thou reflect upon thyself. For without all question, thou thyself art much in fault, if either of one that were of such a disposition, thou didst expect that he should be true unto thee: or when unto any thou didst a good turn, thou didst not there bound thy thoughts, as one that had obtained his end; nor didst not think that from the action itself thou hadst received a full reward of the good that thou hadst done. For what wouldst thou have more? Unto him that is a man, thou hast done a good turn: doth not that suffice thee? What thy nature required, that hast thou done. Must thou be rewarded for it? As if either the eye for that it seeth, or the feet that they go, should require satisfaction. For as these being by nature appointed for such an use, can challenge no more, than that they may work according to their natural constitution: so man being born to do good unto others whensoever he doth a real good unto any by helping them out of error; or though but in middle things, as in matter of wealth, life, preferment, and the like, doth help to further their desires he doth that for which he was made, and therefore can require no more.\n\n\n\nTHE TENTH BOOK\n\n\nI. O my soul, the time I trust will be, when thou shalt be good, simple, single, more open and visible, than that body by which it is enclosed. Thou wilt one day be sensible of their happincss, whose end is love, and their affections dead to all worldly things. Thou shalt one day be full, and in want of no external thing: not seeking pleasure from anything, either living or insensible, that this world can afford; neither wanting time for the continuation of thy pleasure, nor place and opportunity, nor the favour either of the weather or of men. When thou shalt have content in thy present estate, and all things present shall add to thy content: when thou shalt persuade thyself, that thou hast all things; all for thy good, and all by the providence of the Gods: and of things future also shalt be as confident, that all will do well, as tending to the maintenance and preservation in some sort, of his perfect welfare and happiness, who is perfection of life, of goodness, and beauty; who begets all things, and containeth all things in himself, and in himself doth recollect all things from all places that are dissolved, that of them he may beget others again like unto them. Such one day shall be thy disposition, that thou shalt be able, both in regard of the Gods, and in regard of men, so to fit and order thy conversation, as neither to complain of them at any time, for anything that they do; nor to do anything thyself, for which thou mayest justly be condemned.\n\nII. As one who is altogether governed by nature, let it be thy care to observe what it is that thy nature in general doth require. That done, if thou find not that thy nature, as thou art a living sensible creature, will be the worse for it, thou mayest proceed. Next then thou must examine, what thy nature as thou art a living sensible creature, doth require. And that, whatsoever it be, thou mayest admit of and do it, if thy nature as thou art a reasonable living creature, will not be the worse for it. Now whatsoever is reasonable, is also sociable, Keep thyself to these rules, and trouble not thyself about idle things.\n\nIII. Whatsoever doth happen unto thee, thou art naturally by thy natural constitution either able, or not able to bear. If thou beest able, be not offended, but bear it according to thy natural constitution, or as nature hath enabled thee. If thou beest not able, be not offended. For it will soon make an end of thee, and itself, (whatsoever it be) at the same time end with thee. But remember, that whatsoever by the strength of opinion, grounded upon a certain apprehension of both true profit and duty, thou canst conceive tolerable; that thou art able to bear that by thy natural constitution.\n\nIV. Him that offends, to teach with love and meek ness, and to show him his error. But if thou canst not, then to blame thyself; or rather not thyself neither, if thy will and endeavours have not been wanting.\n\nV. Whatsoever it be that happens unto thee, it is that which from all time was appointed unto thee. For by the same coherence of causes, by which thy substance from all eternity was appointed to be, was also whatsoever should happen unto it, destinated and appointed.\n\nVI. Either with Epicurus, we must fondly imagine the atoms to be the cause of all things, or we must needs grant a nature. Let this then be thy first ground, that thou art part of that universe, which is governed by nature. Then secondly, that to those parts that are of the same kind and nature as thou art, thou hast relation of kindred. For of these, if I shall always be mindful, first as I am a part, I shall never be displeased with anything, that falls to my particular share of the common chances of the world. For nothing that is behoveful unto the whole, can be truly hurtful to that which is part of it. For this being the common privilege of all natures, that they contain nothing in themselves that is hurtful unto them; it cannot be that the nature of the universe (whose privilege beyond other particular natures, is, that she cannot against her will by any higher external cause be constrained,) should beget anything and cherish it in her bosom that should tend to her own hurt and prejudice. As then I bear in mind that I am a part of such an universe, I shall not be displeased with anything that happens. And as I have relation of kindred to those parts that are of the same kind and nature that I am, so I shall be careful to do nothing that is prejudicial to the community, but in all my deliberations shall they that are of my kind ever be; and the common good, that, which all my intentions and resolutions shall drive unto, as that which is contrary unto it, I shall by all means endeavour to prevent and avoid. These things once so fixed and concluded, as thou wouldst think him a happy citizen, whose constant study and practice were for the good and benefit of his fellow citizens, and the carriage of the city such towards him, that he were well pleased with it ; so must it needs be with thee, that thou shalt live a happy life.\n\nVII. All parts of the world, (all things I mean that are contained within the whole world, must of necessity at some time or other come to corruption. Alteration I should say, to speak truly and properly; but that I may be the better understood, I am content at this time to use that more common word. Now say I, if so be that this be both hurtful unto them, and yet unavoidable, would not, thinkest thou, the whole itself be in a sweet case, all the parts of it being subject to alteration, yea and by their making itself fitted for corruption, as consisting of things different and contrary? And did nature then either of herself thus project and purpose the affliction and misery of her parts, and therefore of purpose so made them, not only that haply they might, but of necessity that they should fall into evil; or did not she know what she did, when she made them? For either of these two to say, is equally absurd. But to let pass nature in general, and to reason of things particular according to their own particular natures; how absurd and ridiculous is it, first to say that all parts of the whole are, by their proper natural constitution, subject to alteration; and then when any such thing doth happen, as when one doth fall sick and dieth, to take on and wonder as though some strange thing had happened? Though this besides might move not so grievously to take on when any such thing doth happen, that whatsoever is dissolved, it is dissolved into those things, whereof it was compounded. For every dissolution is either a mere dispersion, of the elements into those elements again whereof everything did consist, or a change, of that which is more solid into earth; and of that which is pure and subtile or spiritual, into air. So that by this means nothing is lost, but all resumed again into those rational generative seeds of the universe; and this universe, either after a certain period of time to lie consumed by fire, or by continual changes to be renewed, and so for ever to endure. Now that solid and spiritual that we speak of, thou must not conceive it to be that very same, which at first was, when thou wert born. For alas! all this that now thou art in either kind, either for matter of substance, or of life, hath but two or three days ago partly from meats eaten, and partly from air breathed in, received all its influx, being the same then in no other respect, than a running river, maintained by the perpetual influx and new supply of waters, is the same. That therefore which thou hast since received, not that which came from thy mother, is that which comes to change and corruption. But suppose that that for the general substance, and more solid part of it, should still cleave unto thee never so close, yet what is that to the proper qualities and affections of it, by which persons are distinguished, which certainly are quite different?\n\nVIII. Now that thou hast taken these names upon thee of good, modest, true; of ἔμφρων, σύμφρων, ὑπέρφρων; take heed lest at any times by doing anything that is contrary, thou be but improperly so called, and lose thy right to these appellations. Or if thou do, return unto them again with all possible speed. And remember, that the word ἔμφρων notes unto thee an intent and intelligent consideration of every object that presents itself unto thee, without distraction. And the word σύμφρων a ready and contented acceptation of whatsoever by the appointment of the common nature, happens unto thee. And the word ὑπέρφρων, a superextension, or a transcendent, and outreaching disposition of thy mind, whereby it passeth by all bodily pains and pleasures, honour and credit, death and whatsoever is of the same nature, as matters of absolute indifferency, and in no wise to be stood upon by a wise man. These then if inviolably thou shalt observe, and shalt not be ambitious to be so called by others, both thou thyself shalt become a new man, and thou shalt begin a new life. For to continue such as hitherto thou hast been, to undergo those distractions and distempers as thou must needs for such a life as hitherto thou hast lived, is the part of one that is very foolish, and is overfond of his life. Whom a man might compare to one of those half-eaten wretches, matched in the amphitheatre with wild beasts; who as full as they are all the body over with wounds and blood, desire for a great favour, that they may be reserved till the next day, then also, and in the same estate to be exposed to the same nails and teeth as before. Away therefore, ship thyself; and from the troubles and distractions of thy former life convey thyself as it were unto these few names; and if thou canst abide in them, or be constant in the practice and possession of them, continue there as glad and joyful as one that were translated unto some such place of bliss and happiness as that which by Hesiod and Plato is called the Islands of the Blessed, by others called the Elysian Fields. And whensoever thou findest thyself; that thou art in danger of a relapse, and that thou art not able to master and overcome those difficulties and temptations that present themselves in thy present station: get thee into any private corner, where thou mayst be better able. Or if that will not serve forsake even thy life rather. But so that it be not in passion but in a plain voluntary modest way: this being the only commendable action of thy whole life that thus thou art departed, or this having been the main work and business of thy whole life, that thou mightest thus depart. Now for the better remembrance of those names that we have spoken of, thou shalt find it a very good help, to remember the Gods as often as may be: and that, the thing which they require at our hands of as many of us, as are by nature reasonable creation is not that with fair words, and outward show of piety and devotion we should flatter them, but that we should become like unto them: and that as all other natural creatures, the fig tree for example; the dog the bee: both do, all of them, and apply themselves unto that. which by their natural constitution, is proper unto them; so man likewise should do that, which by his nature, as he is a man, belongs unto him.\n\nIX. Toys and fooleries at home, wars abroad: sometimes terror, sometimes torpor, or stupid sloth : this is thy daily slavery. By little and little, if thou doest not better look to it, those sacred dogmata will be blotted out of thy mind. How many things be there, which when as a mere naturalist, thou hast barely considered of according to their nature, thou doest let pass without any further use? Whereas thou shouldst in all things so join action and contemplation, that thou mightest both at the same time attend all present occasions, to perform everything duly and carefully and yet so intend the contemplative part too, that no part of that delight and pleasure, which the contemplative knowledge of everything according to its true nature doth of itself afford, might be lost. Or, that the true and contemn plative knowledge of everything according to its own nature, might of itself, (action being subject to many lets and impediments) afford unto thee sufficient pleasure and happiness. Not apparent indeed, but not concealed. And when shalt thou attain to the happiness of true simplicity, and unaffected gravity? When shalt thou rejoice in the certain knowledge of every particular object according to its true nature: as what the matter and substance of it is; what use it is for in the world: how long it can subsist: what things it doth consist of: who they be that are capable of it, and who they that can give it, and take it away?\n\nX. As the spider, when it hath caught the fly that it hunted after, is not little proud, nor meanly conceited of herself: as he likewise that hath caught an hare, or hath taken a fish with his net: as another for the taking of a boar, and another of a bear: so may they be proud, and applaud themselves for their valiant acts against the Sarmatai, or northern nations lately defeated. For these also, these famous soldiers and warlike men, if thou dost look into their minds and opinions, what do they for the most part but hunt after prey?\n\nXI. To find out, and set to thyself some certain way and method of contemplation, whereby thou mayest clearly discern and represent unto thyself, the mutual change of all things, the one into the other. Bear it in thy mind evermore, and see that thou be throughly well exercised in this particular. For there is not anything more effectual to beget true magnanimity.\n\nXII. He hath got loose from the bonds of his body, and perceiving that within a very little while he must of necessity bid the world farewell, and leave all these things behind him, he wholly applied himself, as to righteousness in all his actions, so to the common nature in all things that should happen unto him. And contenting himself with these two things, to do all things justly, and whatsoever God doth send to like well of it: what others shall either say or think of him, or shall do against him, he doth not so much as trouble his thoughts with it. To go on straight, whither right and reason directed him, and by so doing to follow God, was the only thing that he did mind, that, his only business and occupation.\n\nXIII. What use is there of suspicion at all? or, why should thoughts of mistrust, and suspicion concerning that which is future, trouble thy mind at all? What now is to be done, if thou mayest search and inquiry into that, what needs thou care for more? And if thou art well able to perceive it alone, let no man divert thee from it. But if alone thou doest not so well perceive it, suspend thine action, and take advice from the best. And if there be anything else that doth hinder thee, go on with prudence and discretion, according to the present occasion and opportunity, still proposing that unto thyself, which thou doest conceive most right and just. For to hit that aright, and to speed in the prosecution of it, must needs be happiness, since it is that only which we can truly and properly be said to miss of, or miscarry in.\n\nXIV. What is that that is slow, and yet quick? merry, and yet grave? He that in all things doth follow reason for his guide.\n\nXV. In the morning as soon as thou art awaked, when thy judgment, before either thy affections, or external objects have wrought upon it, is yet most free and impartial: put this question to thyself, whether if that which is right and just be done, the doing of it by thyself, or by others when thou art not able thyself; be a thing material or no. For sure it is not. And as for these that keep such a life, and stand so much upon the praises, or dispraises of other men, hast thou forgotten what manner of men they be? that such and such upon their beds, and such at their board: what their ordinary actions are: what they pursue after, and what they fly from: what thefts and rapines they commit, if not with their hands and feet, yet with that more precious part of theirs, their minds: which (would it but admit of them) might enjoy faith, modesty, truth, justice, a good spirit.\n\nXVL Give what thou wilt, and take away what thou wilt, saith he that is well taught and truly modest, to Him that gives, and takes away. And it is not out of a stout and peremptory resolution, that he saith it, but in mere love, and humble submission.\n\nXVII. So live as indifferent to the world and all worldly objects, as one who liveth by himself alone upon some desert hill. For whether here, or there, if the whole world be but as one town, it matters not much for the place. Let them behold and see a man, that is a man indeed, living according to the true nature of man. If they cannot bear with me, let them kill me. For better were it to die, than so to live as they would have thee.\n\nXVIII. Make it not any longer a matter of dispute or discourse, what are the signs and proprieties of a good man, but really and actually to be such.\n\nXIX. Ever to represent unto thyself; and to set before thee, both the general age and time of the world, and the whole substance of it. And how all things particular in respect of these are for their substance, as one of the least seeds that is: and for their duration, as the turning of the pestle in the mortar once about. Then to fix thy mind upon every particular object of the world, and to conceive it, (as it is indeed,) as already being in the state of dissolution, and of change; tending to some kind of either putrefaction or dispersion; or whatsoever else it is, that is the death as it were of everything in his own kind.\n\nXX. Consider them through all actions and occupations, of their lives: as when they eat, and when they sleep: when they are in the act of necessary exoneration, and when in the act of lust. Again, when they either are in their greatest exultation; and in the middle of all their pomp and glory; or being angry and displeased, in great state and majesty, as from an higher place, they chide and rebuke. How base and slavish, but a little while ago, they were fain to be, that they might come to this; and within a very little while what will be their estate, when death hath once seized upon them.\n\nXXI. That is best for every one, that the common nature of all doth send unto every one, and then is it best, when she doth send it.\n\nXXII. The earth, saith the poet, doth often long after the rain. So is the glorious sky often as desirous to fall upon the earth, which argues a mutual kind of love between them. And so (say I) doth the world bear a certain affection of love to whatsoever shall come to pass With thine affections shall mine concur, O world. The same (and no other) shall the object of my longing be which is of thine. Now that the world doth love it is true indeed so is it as commonly said, and acknowledged ledged, when, according to the Greek phrase, imitated by the Latins, of things that used to be, we say commonly, that they love to be.\n\nXXIII. Either thou dost Continue in this kind of life and that is it, which so long thou hast been used unto and therefore tolerable: or thou doest retire, or leave the world, and that of thine own accord, and then thou hast thy mind: or thy life is cut off; and then mayst. thou rejoice that thou hast ended thy charge. One of these must needs be. Be therefore of good comfort.\n\nXXIV Let it always appear and be manifest unto thee that solitariness, and desert places, by many philosophers so much esteemed of and affected, are of themselves but thus and thus; and that all things are them to them that live in towns, and converse with others as they are the same nature everywhere to be seen and observed: to them that have retired themselves to the top of mountains, and to desert havens, or what other desert and inhabited places soever. For anywhere it thou wilt mayest thou quickly find and apply that to thyself; which Plato saith of his philosopher, in a place: as private and retired, saith he, as if he were shut up and enclosed about in some shepherd's lodge, on the top of a hill. There by thyself to put these questions to thyself. or to enter in these considerations: What is my chief and principal part, which hath power over the rest? What is now the present estate of it, as I use it; and what is it, that I employ it about? Is it now void of reason ir no ? Is it free, and separated; or so affixed, so congealed and grown together as it were with the flesh, that it is swayed by the motions and inclinations of it?\n\nXXV. He that runs away from his master is a fugitive. But the law is every man's master. He therefore that forsakes the law, is a fugitive. So is he, whosoever he be, that is either sorry, angry, or afraid, or for anything that either hath been, is, or shall be by his appointment, who is the Lord and Governor of the universe. For he truly and properly is Nomoz, or the law, as the only nemwn, or distributor and dispenser of all things that happen unto any one in his lifetime- Whatsoever then is either sorry, angry, or afraid, is a fugitive.\n\nXXVI. From man is the seed, that once cast into the womb man hath no more to do with it. Another cause succeedeth, and undertakes the work, and in time brings a child (that wonderful effect from such a beginning!) to perfection. Again, man lets food down through his throat; and that once down, he hath no more to do with it. Another cause succeedeth and distributeth this food into the senses, and the affections: into life, and into strength; and doth with it those other many and marvellous things, that belong unto man. These things therefore that are so secretly and invisibly wrought and brought to pass, thou must use to behold and contemplate; and not the things themselves only, but the power also by which they are effected; that thou mayst behold it, though not with the eyes of the body, yet as plainly and visibly as thou canst see and discern the outward efficient cause of the depression and elevation of anything.\n\nXXVII. Ever to mind and consider with thyself; how all things that now are, have been heretofore much after the same sort, and after the same fashion that now they are: and so to think of those things which shall be hereafter also. Moreover, whole dramata, and uniform scenes, or scenes that comprehend the lives and actions of men of one calling and profession, as many as either in thine own experience thou hast known, or by reading of ancient histories; (as the whole court of Adrianus, the whole court of Antoninus Pius, the whole court of Philippus, that of Alexander, that of Croesus): to set them all before thine eyes. For thou shalt find that they are all but after one sort and fashion: only that the actors were others.\n\nXXVIII. As a pig that cries and flings when his throat is cut, fancy to thyself every one to be, that grieves for any worldly thing and takes on. Such a one is he also, who upon his bed alone, doth bewail the miseries of this our mortal life. And remember this, that Unto reasonable creatures only it is granted that they may willingly and freely submit unto Providence: but absolutely to submit, is a necessity imposed upon all creatures equally.\n\nXXIX. Whatsoever it is that thou goest about, consider of it by thyself, and ask thyself, What? because I shall do this no more when I am dead, should therefore death seem grievous unto me?\n\nXXX. When thou art offended with any man's transgression, presently reflect upon thyself; and consider what thou thyself art guilty of in the same kind. As that thou also perchance dost think it a happiness either to be rich, or to live in pleasure, or to be praised and commended, and so of the rest in particular. For this if thou shalt call to mind, thou shalt soon forget thine anger; especially when at the same time this also shall concur in thy thoughts, that he was constrained by his error and ignorance so to do: for how can he choose as long as he is of that opinion? Do thou therefore if thou canst, take away that from him, that forceth him to do as he doth.\n\nXXXI. When thou seest Satyro, think of Socraticus and Eutyches, or Hymen, and when Euphrates, think of Eutychio, and Sylvanus, when Alciphron, of Tropaeophorus, when Xenophon, of Crito, or Severus. And when thou doest look upon thyself, fancy unto thyself some one or other of the Caasars; and so for every one, some one or other that hath been for estate and profession answerable unto him. Then let this come to thy mind at the same time; and where now are they all? Nowhere or anywhere? For so shalt thou at all time. be able to perceive how all worldly things are but as the smoke, that vanisheth away: or, indeed, mere nothing. Especially when thou shalt call to mind this also, that whatsoever is once changed, shall never be again as long as the world endureth. And thou then, how long shalt thou endure? And why doth it not suffice thee, if virtuously, and as becometh thee, thou mayest pass that portion of time, how little soever it be, that is allotted unto thee?\n\nXXXII. What a subject, and what a course of life is it, that thou doest so much desire to be rid of. For all these things, what are they, but fit objects for an understanding, that beholdeth everything according to its true nature, to exercise itself upon? Be patient, therefore, until that (as a strong stomach that turns all things into his own nature; and as a great fire that turneth in flame and light, whatsoever thou doest cast into it) thou have made these things also familiar, and as it were natural unto thee.\n\nXXXIII. Let it not be in any man's power, to say truly of thee, that thou art not truly simple, or sincere and open, or not good. Let him be deceived whosoever he be that shall have any such opinion of thee. For all this doth depend of thee. For who is it that should hinder thee from being either truly simple or good? Do thou only resolve rather not to live, than not to be such. For indeed neither doth it stand with reason that he should live that is not such. What then is it that may upon this present occasion according to best reason and discretion, either be said or done? For whatsoever it be, it is in thy power either to do it, or to say it, and therefore seek not any pretences, as though thou wert hindered. Thou wilt never cease groaning and complaining, until such time as that, what pleasure is unto the voluptuous, be unto thee, to do in everything that presents itself, whatsoever may be done conformably and agreeably to the proper constitution of man, or, to man as he is a man. For thou must account that pleasure, whatsoever it be, that thou mayest do according to thine own nature. And to do this, every place will fit thee. Unto the cylindrus, or roller, it is not granted to move everywhere according to its own proper motion, as neither unto the water, nor unto the fire, nor unto any other thing, that either is merely natural, or natural and sensitive; but not rational. for many things there be that can hinder their operations. But of the mind and understanding this is the proper privilege, that according to its own nature, and as it will itself, it can pass through every obstacle that it finds, and keep straight on forwards. Setting therefore before thine eyes this happiness and felicity of thy mind, whereby it is able to pass through all things, and is capable of all motions, whether as the fire, upwards; or as the stone downwards, or as the cylindrus through that which is sloping: content thyself with it, and seek not after any other thing. For all other kind of hindrances that are not hindrances of thy mind either they are proper to the body, or merely proceed from the opinion, reason not making that resistance that it should, but basely, and cowardly suffering itself to be foiled; and of themselves can neither wound, nor do any hurt at all. Else must he of necessity, whosoever he be that meets with any of them, become worse than he was before. For so is it in all other subjects, that that is thought hurtful unto them, whereby they are made worse. But here contrariwise, man (if he make that good use of them that he should) is rather the better and the more praiseworthy for any of those kind of hindrances, than otherwise. But generally remember that nothing can hurt a natural citizen, that is not hurtful unto the city itself, nor anything hurt the city, that is not hurtful unto the law itself. But none of these casualties, or external hindrances, do hurt the law itself; or, are contrary to that course of justice and equity, by which public societies are maintained: neither therefore do they hurt either city or citizen.\n\nXXXIV. As he that is bitten by a mad dog, is afraid of everything almost that he seeth: so unto him, whom the dogmata have once bitten, or in whom true knowledge hath made an impression, everything almost that he sees or reads be it never so short or ordinary, doth afford a good memento; to put him out of all grief and fear, as that of the poet, 'The winds blow upon the trees, and their leaves fall upon the ground. Then do the trees begin to bud again, and by the spring-time they put forth new branches. So is the generation of men; some come into the world, and others go out of it.' Of these leaves then thy children are. And they also that applaud thee so gravely, or, that applaud thy speeches, with that their usual acclamation, axiopistwz, O wisely spoken I and speak well of thee, as on the other side, they that stick not to curse thee, they that privately and secretly dispraise and deride thee, they also are but leaves. And they also that shall follow, in whose memories the names of men famous after death, is preserved, they are but leaves neither. For even so is it of all these worldly things. Their spring comes, and they are put forth. Then blows the wind, and they go down. And then in lieu of them grow others out of the wood or common matter of all things, like unto them. But, to endure but for a while, is common unto all. Why then shouldest thou so earnestly either seek after these things, or fly from them, as though they should endure for ever? Yet a little while, and thine eyes will be closed up, and for him that carries thee to thy grave shall another mourn within a while after.\n\nXXXV. A good eye must be good to see whatsoever is to be seen, and not green things only. For that is proper to sore eyes. So must a good ear, and a good smell be ready for whatsoever is either to be heard, or smelt: and a good stomach as indifferent to all kinds of food, as a millstone is, to whatsoever she was made for to grind. As ready therefore must a sound understanding be for whatsoever shall happen. But he that saith, O that my children might live! and, O that all men might commend me for whatsoever I do! is an eye that seeks after green things; or as teeth, after that which is tender.\n\nXXXVI. There is not any man that is so happy in his death, but that some of those that are by him when he dies, will be ready to rejoice at his supposed calamity. Is it one that was virtuous and wise indeed? will there not some one or other be found, who thus will say to himself; 'Well now at last shall I be at rest from this pedagogue. He did not indeed otherwise trouble us much: but I know well enough that in his heart, he did much condemn us.' Thus will they speak of the virtuous. But as for us, alas I how many things be there, for which there be many that glad would be to be rid of us. This therefore if thou shalt think of whensoever thou diest, thou shalt die the more willingly, when thou shalt think with thyself; I am now to depart from that world, wherein those that have been my nearest friends and acquaintances, they whom I have so much suffered for, so often prayed for, and for whom I have taken such care, even they would have me die, hoping that after my death they shall live happier, than they did before. What then should any man desire to continue here any longer? Nevertheless, whensoever thou diest, thou must not be less kind and loving unto them for it; but as before, see them, continue to be their friend, to wish them well, and meekly, and gently to carry thyself towards them, but yet so that on the other side, it make thee not the more unwilling to die. But as it fareth with them that die an easy quick death, whose soul is soon separated from their bodies, so must thy separation from them be. To these had nature joined and annexed me: now she parts us; I am ready to depart, as from friends and kinsmen, but yet without either reluctancy or compulsion. For this also is according to Nature.\n\nXXXVII. Use thyself; as often, as thou seest any man do anything, presently (if it be possible) to say unto thyself, What is this man's end in this his action? But begin this course with thyself first of all, and diligently examine thyself concerning whatsoever thou doest.\n\nXXXVIII. Remember, that that which sets a man at work, and hath power over the affections to draw them either one way, or the other way, is not any external thing properly, but that which is hidden within every man's dogmata, and opinions: That, that is rhetoric; that is life; that (to speak true) is man himself. As for thy body, which as a vessel, or a case, compasseth thee about, and the many and curious instruments that it hath annexed unto it, let them not trouble thy thoughts. For of themselves they are but as a carpenter's axe, but that they are born with us, and naturally sticking unto us. But otherwise, without the inward cause that hath power to move them, and to restrain them, those parts are of themselves of no more use unto us, than the shuttle is of itself to the weaver, or the pen to the writer, or the whip to the coachman.\n\n\n\nTHE ELEVENTH BOOK\n\n\nI. The natural properties, and privileges of a reasonable soul are: That she seeth herself; that she can order, and compose herself: that she makes herself as she will herself: that she reaps her own fruits whatsoever, whereas plants, trees, unreasonable creatures, what fruit soever (be it either fruit properly, or analogically only) they bear, they bear them unto others, and not to themselves. Again; whensoever, and wheresoever, sooner or later, her life doth end, she hath her own end nevertheless. For it is not with her, as with dancers and players, who if they be interrupted in any part of their action, the whole action must needs be imperfect: but she in what part of time or action soever she be surprised, can make that which she bath in her hand whatsoever it be, complete and full, so that she may depart with that comfort, 'I have lived; neither want I anything of that which properly did belong unto me.' Again, she compasseth the whole world, and penetrateth into the vanity, and mere outside (wanting substance and solidity) of it, and stretcheth herself unto the infiniteness of eternity; and the revolution or restoration of all things after a certain period of time, to the same state and place as before, she fetcheth about, and doth comprehend in herself; and considers withal, and sees clearly this, that neither they that shall follow us, shall see any new thing, that we have not seen, nor they that went before, anything more than we: but that he that is once come to forty (if he have any wit at all) can in a manner (for that they are all of one kind) see all things, both past and future. As proper is it, and natural to the soul of man to love her neighbour, to be true and modest; and to regard nothing so much as herself: which is also the property of the law: whereby by the way it appears, that sound reason and justice comes all to one, and therefore that justice is the chief thing, that reasonable creatures ought to propose unto themselves as their end.\n\nII. A pleasant song or dance; the Pancratiast's exercise, sports that thou art wont to be much taken with, thou shalt easily contemn; if the harmonious voice thou shalt divide into so many particular sounds whereof it doth consist, and of every one in particular shall ask thyself; whether this or that sound is it, that doth so conquer thee. For thou wilt be ashamed of it. And so for shame, if accordingly thou shalt consider it, every particular motion and posture by itself: and so for the wrestler's exercise too. Generally then, whatsoever it be, besides virtue, and those things that proceed from virtue that thou art subject to be much affected with, remember presently thus to divide it, and by this kind of division, in each particular to attain unto the contempt of the whole. This thou must transfer and apply to thy whole life also.\n\nIII. That soul which is ever ready, even now presently (if need be) from the body, whether by way of extinction, or dispersion, or continuation in another place and estate to be separated, how blessed and happy is it! But this readiness of it, it must proceed, not from an obstinate and peremptory resolution of the mind, violently and passionately set upon Opposition, as Christians are wont; but from a peculiar judgment; with discretion and gravity, so that others may be persuaded also and drawn to the like example, but without any noise and passionate exclamations.\n\nIV. Have I done anything charitably? then am I benefited by it. See that this upon all occasions may present itself unto thy mind, and never cease to think of it. What is thy profession? to be good. And how should this be well brought to pass, but by certain theorems and doctrines; some Concerning the nature of the universe, and some Concerning the proper and particular constitution of man?\n\nV. Tragedies were at first brought in and instituted, to put men in mind of worldly chances and casualties: that these things in the ordinary course of nature did so happen: that men that were much pleased and delighted by such accidents upon this stage, would not by the same things in a greater stage be grieved and afflicted: for here you see what is the end of all such things; and that even they that cry out so mournfully to Cithaeron, must bear them for all their cries and exclamations, as well as others. And in very truth many good things are spoken by these poets; as that (for example) is an excellent passage: 'But if so be that I and my two children be neglected by the Gods, they have some reason even for that,' &c. And again, 'It will but little avail thee to storm and rage against the things themselves,' &c. Again, 'To reap one's life, as a ripe ear of corn;' and whatsoever else is to be found in them, that is of the same kind. After the tragedy, the ancient tomedy was brought in, which had the liberty to inveigh against personal vices; being therefore through this her freedom and liberty of speech of very good use and effect, to restrain men from pride and arrogancy. To which end it was, that Diogenes took also the same liberty. After these, what were either the Middle, or New Comedy admitted for, but merely, (Or for the most part at least) for the delight and pleasure of curious and excellent imitation? 'It will steal away; look to it,' &c. Why, no man denies, but that these also have some good things whereof that may be one: but the whole drift and foundation of that kind of dramatical poetry, what is it else, but as we have said?\n\nVI. How clearly doth it appear unto thee, that no other course of thy life could fit a true philosopher's practice better, than this very course, that thou art now already in?\n\nVII. A branch cut off from the continuity of that which was next unto it, must needs be cut off from the whole tree: so a man that is divided from another man, is divided from the whole society. A branch is cut off by another, but he that hates and is averse, cuts himself off from his neighbour, and knows not that at the same time he divides himself from the whole body, or corporation. But herein is the gift and mercy of God, the Author of this society, in that, once cut off we may grow together and become part of the whole again. But if this happen often the misery is that the further a man is run in this division, the harder he is to be reunited and restored again: and however the branch which, once cut of afterwards was graffed in, gardeners can tell you is not like that which sprouted together at first, and still continued in the unity of the body.\n\nVIII. To grow together like fellow branches in matter of good correspondence and affection; but not in matter of opinions. They that shall oppose thee in thy right courses, as it is not in their power to divert thee from thy good action, so neither let it be to divert thee from thy good affection towards them. But be it thy care to keep thyself constant in both; both in a right judgment and action, and in true meekness towards them, that either shall do their endeavour to hinder thee, or at least will be displeased with thee for what thou hast done. For to fail in either (either in the one to give over for fear, or in the other to forsake thy natural affection towards him, who by nature is both thy friend and thy kinsman) is equally base, and much savouring of the disposition of a cowardly fugitive soldier.\n\nIX. It is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art, since that all arts imitate nature. If this be so; that the most perfect and general nature of all natures should in her operation come short of the skill of arts, is most improbable. Now common is it to all arts, to make that which is worse for the better's sake. Much more then doth the common nature do the same. Hence is the first ground of justice. From justice all other virtues have their existence. For justice cannot be preserved, if either we settle our minds and affections upon worldly things; or be apt to be deceived, or rash, and inconstant.\n\nX. The things themselves (which either to get or to avoid thou art put to so much trouble) come not unto thee themselves; but thou in a manner goest unto them. Let then thine own judgment and opinion concerning those things be at rest; and as for the things themselves, they stand still and quiet, without any noise or stir at all; and so shall all pursuing and flying cease.\n\nXI. Then is the soul as Empedocles doth liken it, like unto a sphere or globe, when she is all of one form and figure: when she neither greedily stretcheth out herself unto anything, nor basely contracts herself, or lies flat and dejected; but shineth all with light, whereby she does see and behold the true nature, both that of the universe, and her own in particular.\n\nXII. Will any contemn me? let him look to that, upon what grounds he does it: my care shall be that I may never be found either doing or speaking anything that doth truly deserve contempt. Will any hate me? let him look to that. I for my part will be kind and loving unto all, and even unto him that hates me, whomsoever he be, will I be ready to show his error, not by way of exprobation or ostentation of my patience, but ingenuously and meekly: such as was that famous Phocion, if so be that he did not dissemble. For it is inwardly that these things must be: that the Gods who look inwardly, and not upon the outward appearance, may behold a man truly free from all indignation and grief. For what hurt can it be unto thee whatsoever any man else doth, as long as thou mayest do that which is proper and suitable to thine own nature? Wilt not thou (a man wholly appointed to be both what, and as the common good shall require) accept of that which is now seasonable to the nature of the universe?\n\nXIII. They contemn one another, and yet they seek to please one another: and whilest they seek to surpass one another in worldly pomp and greatness, they most debase and prostitute themselves in their better part one to another.\n\nXIV. How rotten and insincere is he, that saith, I am resolved to carry myself hereafter towards you with all ingenuity and simplicity. O man, what doest thou mean! what needs this profession of thine? the thing itself will show it. It ought to be written upon thy forehead. No sooner thy voice is heard, than thy countenance must be able to show what is in thy mind: even as he that is loved knows presently by the looks of his sweetheart what is in her mind. Such must he be for all the world, that is truly simple and good, as he whose arm-holes are offensive, that whosoever stands by, as soon as ever he comes near him, may as it were smell him whether he will or no. But the affectation of simplicity is nowise laudable. There is nothing more shameful than perfidious friendship. Above all things, that must be avoided. However true goodness, simplicity, and kindness cannot so be hidden, but that as we have already said in the very eyes and countenance they will show themselves.\n\nXV. To live happily is an inward power of the soul, when she is affected with indifferency, towards those things that are by their nature indifferent. To be thus affected she must consider all worldly objects both divided and whole: remembering withal that no object can of itself beget any opinion in us, neither can come to us, but stands without still and quiet; but that we ourselves beget, and as it were print in ourselves opinions concerning them. Now it is in our power, not to print them; and if they creep in and lurk in some corner, it is in our power to wipe them off. Remembering moreover, that this care and circumspection of thine, is to continue but for a while, and then thy life will be at an end. And what should hinder, but that thou mayest do well with all these things? For if they be according to nature, rejoice in them, and let them be pleasing and acceptable unto thee. But if they be against nature, seek thou that which is according to thine own nature, and whether it be for thy credit or no, use all possible speed for the attainment of it: for no man ought to be blamed, for seeking his own good and happiness. XVI. Of everything thou must consider from whence it came, of what things it doth consist, and into what it will be changed: what will be the nature of it, or what it will be like unto when it is changed; and that it can suffer no hurt by this change. And as for other men's either foolishness or wickedness, that it may not trouble and grieve thee; first generally thus; What reference have I unto these? and that we are all born for one another's good: then more particularly after another consideration; as a ram is first in a flock of sheep, and a bull in a herd of cattle, so am I born to rule over them. Begin yet higher, even from this: if atoms be not the beginning of all things, than which to believe nothing can be more absurd, then must we needs grant that there is a nature, that doth govern the universe. If such a nature, then are all worse things made for the better's sake; and all better for one another's sake. Secondly, what manner of men they be, at board, and upon their beds, and so forth. But above all things, how they are forced by their opinions that they hold, to do what they do; and even those things that they do, with what pride and self-conceit they do them. Thirdly, that if they do these things rightly, thou hast no reason to be grieved. But if not rightly, it must needs be that they do them against their wills, and through mere ignorance. For as, according to Plato's opinion, no soul doth willingly err, so by consequent neither doth it anything otherwise than it ought, but against her will. Therefore are they grieved, whensoever they hear themselves charged, either of injustice, or unconscionableness, or covetousness, or in general, of any injurious kind of dealing towards their neighbours. Fourthly, that thou thyself doest transgress in many things, and art even such another as they are. And though perchance thou doest forbear the very act of some sins, yet hast thou in thyself an habitual disposition to them, but that either through fear, or vainglory, or some such other ambitious foolish respect, thou art restrained. Fifthly, that whether they have sinned or no, thou doest not understand perfectly. For many things are done by way of discreet policy; and generally a man must know many things first, before he be able truly and judiciously to judge of another man's action. Sixthly, that whensoever thou doest take on grievously, or makest great woe, little doest thou remember then that a man's life is but for a moment of time, and that within a while we shall all be in our graves. Seventhly, that it is not the sins and transgressions themselves that trouble us properly; for they have their existence in their minds and understandings only, that commit them; but our own opinions concerning those sins. Remove then, and be content to part with that conceit of thine, that it is a grievous thing, and thou hast removed thine anger. But how should I remove it? How? reasoning with thyself that it is not shameful. For if that which is shameful, be not the only true evil that is, thou also wilt be driven whilest thou doest follow the common instinct of nature, to avoid that which is evil, to commit many unjust things, and to become a thief, and anything, that will make to the attainment of thy intended worldly ends. Eighthly, how many things may and do oftentimes follow upon such fits of anger and grief; far more grievous in themselves, than those very things which we are so grieved or angry for. Ninthly, that meekness is a thing unconquerable, if it be true and natural, and not affected or hypocritical. For how shall even the most fierce and malicious that thou shalt conceive, be able to hold on against thee, if thou shalt still continue meek and loving unto him; and that even at that time, when he is about to do thee wrong, thou shalt be well disposed, and in good temper, with all meekness to teach him, and to instruct him better? As for example; My son, we were not born for this, to hurt and annoy one another; it will be thy hurt not mine, my son: and so to show him forcibly and fully, that it is so in very deed: and that neither bees do it one to another, nor any other creatures that are naturally sociable. But this thou must do, not scoffingly, not by way of exprobation, but tenderly without any harshness of words. Neither must thou do it by way of exercise, or ostentation, that they that are by and hear thee, may admire thee: but so always that nobody be privy to it, but himself alone: yea, though there be more present at the same time. These nine particular heads, as so many gifts from the Muses, see that thou remember well: and begin one day, whilest thou art yet alive, to be a man indeed. But on the other side thou must take heed, as much to flatter them, as to be angry with them: for both are equally uncharitable, and equally hurtful. And in thy passions, take it presently to thy consideration, that to be angry is not the part of a man, but that to be meek and gentle, as it savours of more humanity, so of more manhood. That in this, there is strength and nerves, or vigour and fortitude: whereof anger and indignation is altogether void. For the nearer everything is unto unpassionateness, the nearer it is unto power. And as grief doth proceed from weakness, so doth anger. For both, both he that is angry and that grieveth, have received a wound, and cowardly have as it were yielded themselves unto their affections. If thou wilt have a tenth also, receive this tenth gift from Hercules the guide and leader of the Muses: that is a mad man's part, to look that there should be no wicked men in the world, because it is impossible. Now for a man to brook well enough, that there should be wicked men in the world, but not to endure that any should transgress against himself, is against all equity, and indeed tyrannical.\n\nXVII. Four several dispositions or inclinations there be of the mind and understanding, which to be aware of, thou must carefully observe: and whensoever thou doest discover them, thou must rectify them, saying to thyself concerning every one of them, This imagination is not necessary; this is uncharitable: this thou shalt speak as another man's slave, or instrument; than which nothing can be more senseless and absurd: for the fourth, thou shalt sharply check and upbraid thyself; for that thou doest suffer that more divine part in thee, to become subject and obnoxious to that more ignoble part of thy body, and the gross lusts and concupiscences thereof.\n\nXVIII. What portion soever, either of air or fire there be in thee, although by nature it tend upwards, submitting nevertheless to the ordinance of the universe, it abides here below in this mixed body. So whatsoever is in thee, either earthy, or humid, although by nature it tend downwards, yet is it against its nature both raised upwards, and standing, or consistent. So obedient are even the elements themselves to the universe, abiding patiently wheresoever (though against their nature) they are placed, until the sound as it were of their retreat, and separation. Is it not a grievous thing then, that thy reasonable part only should be disobedient, and should not endure to keep its place: yea though it be nothing enjoined that is contrary unto it, but that only which is according to its nature? For we cannot say of it when it is disobedient, as we say of the fire, or air, that it tends upwards towards its proper element, for then goes it the quite contrary way. For the motion of the mind to any injustice, or incontinency, or to sorrow, or to fear, is nothing else but a separation from nature. Also when the mind is grieved for anything that is happened by the divine providence, then doth it likewise forsake its own place. For it was ordained unto holiness and godliness, which specially consist in an humble submission to God and His providence in all things; as well as unto justice: these also being part of those duties, which as naturally sociable, we are bound unto; and without which we cannot happily converse one with another: yea and the very ground and fountain indeed of all just actions.\n\nXIX. He that hath not one and the self-same general end always as long as he liveth, cannot possibly be one and the self-same man always. But this will not suffice except thou add also what ought to be this general end. For as the general conceit and apprehension of all those things which upon no certain ground are by the greater part of men deemed good, cannot be uniform and agreeable, but that only which is limited and restrained by some certain proprieties and conditions, as of community: that nothing be conceived good, which is not commonly and publicly good: so must the end also that we propose unto ourselves, be common and sociable. For he that doth direct all his own private motions and purposes to that end, all his actions will be agreeable and uniform; and by that means will be still the same man.\n\nXX. Remember the fable of the country mouse and the city mouse, and the great fright and terror that this was put into.\n\nXXI. Socrates was wont to call the common conceits and opinions of men, the common bugbears of the world : the proper terror of silly children.\n\nXXII. The Lacedaemonians at their public spectacles were wont to appoint seats and forms for their strangers in the shadow, they themselves were content to sit anywhere.\n\nXXIII. What Socrates answered unto Perdiccas, why he did not come unto him, Lest of all deaths I should die the worst kind of death, said he: that is, not able to requite the good that hath been done unto me.\n\nXXIV. In the ancient mystical letters of the Ephesians, there was an item, that a man should always have in his mind some one or other of the ancient worthies.\n\nXXV. The Pythagoreans were wont betimes in the morning the first thing they did, to look up unto the heavens, to put themselves in mind of them who constantly and invariably did perform their task: as also to put themselves in mind of orderliness, or good order, and of purity, and of naked simplicity. For no star or planet hath any cover before it.\n\nXXVI. How Socrates looked, when he was fain to gird himself with a skin, Xanthippe his wife having taken away his clothes, and carried them abroad with her, and what he said to his fellows and friends, who were ashamed; and out of respect to him, did retire themselves when they saw him thus decked.\n\nXXVII. In matter of writing or reading thou must needs be taught before thou can do either: much more in matter of life. 'For thou art born a mere slave, to thy senses and brutish affections;' destitute without teaching of all true knowledge and sound reason.\n\nXXVIII. 'My heart smiled within me.' 'They will accuse even virtue herself; with heinous and opprobrious words.'\n\nXXIX. As they that long after figs in winter when they cannot be had; so are they that long after children, before they be granted them.\n\nXXX. 'As often as a father kisseth his child, he should say secretly with himself' (said Epictetus,) 'tomorrow perchance shall he die.' But these words be ominous. No words ominous (said he) that signify anything that is natural: in very truth and deed not more ominous than this, 'to cut down grapes when they are ripe.' Green grapes, ripe grapes, dried grapes, or raisins: so many changes and mutations of one thing, not into that which was not absolutely, but rather so many several changes and mutations, not into that which hath no being at all, but into that which is not yet in being.\n\nXXXI. 'Of the free will there is no thief or robber:' out of Epictetus; Whose is this also: that we should find a certain art and method of assenting; and that we should always observe with great care and heed the inclinations of our minds, that they may always be with their due restraint and reservation, always charitable, and according to the true worth of every present object. And as for earnest longing, that we should altogether avoid it: and to use averseness in those things only, that wholly depend of our own wills. It is not about ordinary petty matters, believe it, that all our strife and contention is, but whether, with the vulgar, we should be mad, or by the help of philosophy wise and sober, said he.\n\nXXXII. Socrates said, 'What will you have? the souls of reasonable, or unreasonable creatures? Of reasonable. But what? Of those whose reason is sound and perfect? or of those whose reason is vitiated and corrupted? Of those whose reason is sound and perfect. Why then labour ye not for such? Because we have them already. What then do ye so strive and contend between you?'\n\n\n\nTHE TWELFTH BOOK\n\n\nI. Whatsoever thou doest hereafter aspire unto, thou mayest even now enjoy and possess, if thou doest not envy thyself thine own happiness. And that will be, if thou shalt forget all that is past, and for the future, refer thyself wholly to the Divine Providence, and shalt bend and apply all thy present thoughts and intentions to holiness and righteousness. To holiness, in accepting willingly whatsoever is sent by the Divine Providence, as being that which the nature of the universe hath appointed unto thee, which also hath appointed thee for that, whatsoever it be. To righteousness, in speaking the truth freely, and without ambiguity; and in doing all things justly and discreetly. Now in this good course, let not other men's either wickedness, or opinion, or voice hinder thee: no, nor the sense of this thy pampered mass of flesh: for let that which suffers, look to itself. If therefore whensoever the time of thy departing shall come, thou shalt readily leave all things, and shalt respect thy mind only, and that divine part of thine, and this shall be thine only fear, not that some time or other thou shalt cease to live, but thou shalt never begin to live according to nature : then shalt thou be a man indeed, worthy of that world, from which thou hadst thy beginning; then shalt thou cease to be a stranger in thy country, and to wonder at those things that happen daily, as things strange and unexpected, and anxiously to depend of divers things that are not in thy power.\n\nII. God beholds our minds and understandings, bare and naked from these material vessels, and outsides, and all earthly dross. For with His simple and pure understanding, He pierceth into our inmost and purest parts, which from His, as it were by a water pipe and channel, first flowed and issued. This if thou also shalt use to do, thou shalt rid thyself of that manifold luggage, wherewith thou art round about encumbered. For he that does regard neither his body, nor his clothing, nor his dwelling, nor any such external furniture, must needs gain unto himself great rest and ease. Three things there be in all, which thou doest consist of; thy body, thy life, and thy mind. Of these the two former, are so far forth thine, as that thou art bound to take care for them. But the third alone is that which is properly thine. If then thou shalt separate from thyself, that is from thy mind, whatsoever other men either do or say, or whatsoever thou thyself hast heretofore either done or said; and all troublesome thoughts concerning the future, and whatsoever, (as either belonging to thy body or life:) is without the jurisdiction of thine own will, and whatsoever in the ordinary course of human chances and accidents doth happen unto thee; so that thy mind (keeping herself loose and free from all outward coincidental entanglements; always in a readiness to depart:) shall live by herself, and to herself, doing that which is just, accepting whatsoever doth happen, and speaking the truth always; if, I say, thou shalt separate from thy mind, whatsoever by sympathy might adhere unto it, and all time both past and future, and shalt make thyself in all points and respects, like unto Empedocles his allegorical sphere, 'all round and circular,' &c., and shalt think of no longer life than that which is now present: then shalt thou be truly able to pass the remainder of thy days without troubles and distractions; nobly and generously disposed, and in good favour and correspondency, with that spirit which is within thee.\n\nIII. I have often wondered how it should come to pass, that every man loving himself best, should more regard other men's opinions concerning himself than his own. For if any God or grave master standing by, should command any of us to think nothing by himself but what he should presently speak out; no man were able to endure it, though but for one day. Thus do we fear more what our neighbours will think of us, than what we ourselves.\n\nIV. how come it to pass that the Gods having ordered all other things so well and so lovingly, should be overseen in this one only thing, that whereas then. hath been some very good men that have made many covenants as it were with God and by many holy actions and outward services contracted a kind of familiarity with Him; that these men when once they are dead, should never be restored to life, but be extinct for ever. But this thou mayest be sure of, that this (if it be so indeed) would never have been so ordered by the Gods, had it been fit otherwise. For certainly it was possible, had it been more just so and had it been according to nature, the nature of the universe would easily have borne it. But now because it is not so, (if so be that it be not so indeed) be therefore confident that it was not fit it should be so. for thou seest thyself, that now seeking after this matter, how freely thou doest argue and contest with God. But were not the Gods both just and good in the highest degree, thou durst not thus reason with them. Now if just and good, it could not be that in the creation of the world, they should either unjustly or unreasonably oversee anything.\n\nV. Use thyself even unto those things that thou doest at first despair of. For the left hand we see, which for the most part hieth idle because not used; yet doth it hold the bridle with more strength than the right, because it hath been used unto it.\n\nVI. Let these be the objects of thy ordinary meditation: to consider, what manner of men both for soul and body we ought to be, whensoever death shall surprise us: the shortness of this our mortal life: the immense vastness of the time that hath been before, and will he after us: the frailty of every worldly material object: all these things to consider, and behold clearly in themselves, all disguisement of external outside being removed and taken away. Again, to consider the efficient causes of all things: the proper ends and references of all actions: what pain is in itself; what pleasure, what death: what fame or honour, how every man is the true and proper ground of his own rest and tranquillity, and that no man can truly be hindered by any other: that all is but conceit and opinion. As for the use of thy dogmata, thou must carry thyself in the practice of them, rather like unto a pancratiastes, or one that at the same time both fights and wrestles with hands and feet, than a gladiator. For this, if he lose his sword that he fights with, he is gone: whereas the other hath still his hand free, which he may easily turn and manage at his will.\n\nVII. All worldly things thou must behold and consider, dividing them into matter, form, and reference, or their proper end.\n\nVIII. How happy is man in this his power that hath been granted unto him: that he needs not do anything but what God shall approve, and that he may embrace contentedly, whatsoever God doth send unto him?\n\nIX. Whatsoever doth happen in the ordinary course and consequence of natural events, neither the Gods, (for it is not possible, that they either wittingly or unwittingly should do anything amiss) nor men, (for it is through ignorance, and therefore against their wills that they do anything amiss) must he accused. None then must be accused.\n\nX. How ridiculous and strange is he, that wonders at anything that happens in this life in the ordinary course of nature!\n\nXI. Either fate, (and that either an absolute necessity, and unavoidable decree; or a placable and flexible Providence) or all is a mere casual confusion, void of all order and government. If an absolute and unavoidable necessity, why doest thou resist? If a placable and exorable Providence, make thyself worthy of the divine help and assistance. If all be a mere confusion without any moderator, or governor, then hast thou reason to congratulate thyself; that in such a general flood of confusion thou thyself hast obtained a reasonable faculty, whereby thou mayest govern thine own life and actions. But if thou beest carried away with the flood, it must be thy body perchance, or thy life, or some other thing that belongs unto them that is carried away: thy mind and understanding cannot. Or should it be so, that the light of a candle indeed is still bright and lightsome until it be put out : and should truth, and righteousness, and temperance cease to shine in thee whiTest thou thyself bast any being?\n\nXII. At the conceit and apprehension that such and such a one hath sinned, thus reason with thyself; What do I know whether this be a sin indeed, as it seems to be? But if it be, what do I know but that he himself hath already condemned himself for it? And that is all one as if a man should scratch and tear his own face, an object of compassion rather than of anger. Again, that he that would not have a vicious man to sin, is like unto him that would not have moisture in the fig, nor children to welp nor a horse to neigh, nor anything else that in the course of nature is necessary. For what shall he do that hath such an habit? If thou therefore beest powerful and eloquent, remedy it if thou canst.\n\nXIII. If it be not fitting, do it not. If it be not true, speak it not. Ever maintain thine own purpose and resolution free from all compulsion and necessity.\n\nXIV. Of everything that presents itself unto thee, to consider what the true nature of it is, and to unfold it, as it were, by dividing it into that which is formal : that which is material: the true use or end of it, and the just time that it is appointed to last.\n\nXV. It is high time for thee, to understand that there is somewhat in thee, better and more divine than either thy passions, or thy sensual appetites and affections. What is now the object of my mind, is it fear, or suspicion, or lust, or any such thing? To do nothing rashly without some certain end; let that be thy first care. The next, to have no other end than the common good. For, alas! yet a little while, and thou art no more: no more will any, either of those things that now thou seest, or of those men that now are living, be any more. For all things are by nature appointed soon to be changed, turned, and corrupted, that other things might succced in their room.\n\nXVI. Remember that all is but opinion, and all opinion depends of the mind. Take thine opinion away, and then as a ship that hath stricken in within the arms and mouth of the harbour, a present calm; all things safe and steady: a bay, not capable of any storms and tempests: as the poet hath it.\n\nXVII. No operation whatsoever it he, ceasing for a while, can be truly said to suffer any evil, because it is at an end. Neither can he that is the author of that operation; for this very respect, because his operation is at an end, be said to suffer any evil. Likewise then, neither can the whole body of all our actions (which is our life) if in time it cease, be said to suffer any evil for this very reason, because it is at an end; nor he truly be said to have been ill affected, that did put a period to this series of actions. Now this time or certain period, depends of the determination of nature: sometimes of particular nature, as when a man dieth old; but of nature in general, however; the parts whereof thus changing one after another, the whole world still continues fresh and new. Now that is ever best and most seasonable, which is for the good of the whole. Thus it appears that death of itself can neither be hurtful to any in particular, because it is not a shameful thing (for neither is it a thing that depends of our own will, nor of itself contrary to the common good) and generally, as it is both expedient and seasonable to the whole, that in that respect it must needs be good. It is that also, which is brought unto us by the order and appointment of the Divine Providence; so that he whose will and mind in these things runs along with the Divine ordinance, and by this concurrence of his will and mind with the Divine Providence, is led and driven along, as it were by God Himself; may truly be termed and esteemed the *OEo~p7poc*, or divinely led and inspired.\n\nXVIII. These three things thou must have always in a readiness: first concerning thine own actions, whether thou doest nothing either idly, or otherwise, than justice and equity do require: and concerning those things that happen unto thee externally, that either they happen unto thee by chance, or by providence; of which two to accuse either, is equally against reason. Secondly, what like unto our bodies are whilest yet rude and imperfect, until they be animated: and from their animation, until their expiration: of what things they are compounded, and into what things they shall be dissolved. Thirdly, how vain all things will appear unto thee when, from on high as it were, looking down thou shalt contemplate all things upon earth, and the wonderful mutability, that they are subject unto: considering withal, the infinite both greatness and variety of things aerial and things celestial that are round about it. And that as often as thou shalt behold them, thou shalt still see the same: as the same things, so the same shortness of continuance of all those things. And, behold, these be the things that we are so proud and puffed up for.\n\nXIX. Cast away from thee opinion, and thou art safe. And what is it that hinders thee from casting of it away? When thou art grieved at anything, hast thou forgotten that all things happen according to the nature of the universe; and that him only it concerns, who is in fault; and moreover, that what is now done, is that which from ever hath been done in the world, and will ever be done, and is now done everywhere: how nearly all men are allied one to another by a kindred not of blood, nor of seed, but of the same mind. Thou hast also forgotten that every man's mind partakes of the Deity, and issueth from thence; and that no man can properly call anything his own, no not his son, nor his body, nor his life; for that they all proceod from that One who is the giver of all things: that all things are but opinion; that no man lives properly, but that very instant of time which is now present. And therefore that no man whensoever he dieth can properly be said to lose any more, than an instant of time.\n\nXX. Let thy thoughts ever run upon them, who once for some one thing or other, were moved with extraordinary indignation; who were once in the highest pitch of either honour, or calamity; or mutual hatred and enmity; or of any other fortune or condition whatsoever. Then consider what's now become of all those things. All is turned to smoke; all to ashes, and a mere fable; and perchance not so much as a fable. As also whatsoever is of this nature, as Fabius Catulinus in the field; Lucius Lupus, and Stertinius, at Baiae Tiberius at Caprem: and Velius Rufus, and all such examples of vehement prosecution in worldly matters; let these also run in thy mind at the same time; and how vile every object of such earnest and vehement prosecution is; and how much more agreeable to true philosophy it is, for a man to carry himself in every matter that offers itself; justly, and moderately, as one that followeth the Gods with all simplicity. For, for a man to be proud and high conceited, that he is not proud and high conceited, is of all kind of pride and presumption, the most intolerable.\n\nXXI. To them that ask thee, Where hast thou seen the Gods, or how knowest thou certainly that there be Gods, that thou art so devout in their worship? I answer first of all, that even to the very eye, they are in some manner visible and apparent. Secondly, neither have I ever seen mine own soul, and yet I respect and honour it. So then for the Gods, by the daily experience that I have of their power and providence towards myself and others, I know certainly that they are, and therefore worship them.\n\nXXII. Herein doth consist happiness of life, for a man to know thoroughly the true nature of everything; what is the matter, and what is the form of it: with all his heart and soul, ever to do that which is just, and to speak the truth. What then remaineth but to enjoy thy life in a course and coherence of good actions, one upon another immediately succeeding, and never interrupted, though for never so little a while?\n\nXXIII. There is but one light of the sun, though it be intercepted by walls and mountains, and other thousand objects. There is but one common substance of the whole world, though it be concluded and restrained into several different bodies, in number infinite. There is but one common soul, though divided into innumerable particular essences and natures. So is there but one common intellectual soul, though it seem to be divided. And as for all other parts of those generals which we have mentioned, as either sensitive souls or subjects, these of themselves (as naturally irrational) have no common mutual reference one unto another, though many of them contain a mind, or reasonable faculty in them, whereby they are ruled and governed. But of every reasonable mind, this the particular nature, that it hath reference to whatsoever is of her own kind, and desireth to be united: neither can this common affection, or mutual unity and correspondency, be here intercepted or divided, or confined to particulars as those other common things are.\n\nXXIV. What doest thou desire? To live long. What? To enjoy the operations of a sensitive soul; or of the appetitive faculty? or wouldst thou grow, and then decrease again? Wouldst thou long be able to talk, to think and reason with thyself? Which of all these seems unto thee a worthy object of thy desire? Now if of all these thou doest find that they be but little worth in themselves, proceed on unto the last, which is, in all things to follow God and reason. But for a man to grieve that by death he shall be deprived of any of these things, is both against God and reason.\n\nXXV. What a small portion of vast and infinite eternity it is, that is allowed unto every one of us, and how soon it vanisheth into the general age of the world: of the common substance, and of the common soul also what a small portion is allotted unto us: and in what a little clod of the whole earth (as it were) it is that thou doest crawl. After thou shalt rightly have considered these things with thyself; fancy not anything else in the world any more to be of any weight and moment but this, to do that only which thine own nature doth require; and to conform thyself to that which the common nature doth afford.\n\nXXVI. What is the present estate of my understanding? For herein lieth all indeed. As for all other things, they are without the compass of mine own will: and if without the compass of my will, then are they as dead things unto me, and as it were mere smoke.\n\nXXVII. To stir up a man to the contempt of death this among other things, is of good power and efficacy, that even they who esteemed pleasure to be happiness, and pain misery, did nevertheless many of them contemn death as much as any. And can death be terrible to him, to whom that only seems good, which in the ordinary course of nature is seasonable? to him, to whom, whether his actions be many or few, so they be all good, is all one; and who whether he behold the things of the world being always the same either for many years, or for few years only, is altogether indifferent? O man! as a citizen thou hast lived, and conversed in this great city the world. Whether just for so many years, or no, what is it unto thee? Thou hast lived (thou mayest be sure) as long as the laws and orders of the city required; which may be the common comfort of all. Why then should it be grievous unto thee, if (not a tyrant, nor an unjust judge, but) the same nature that brought thee in, doth now send thee out of the world? As if the praetor should fairly dismiss him from the stage, whom he had taken in to act a while. Oh, but the play is not yet at an end, there are but three acts yet acted of it? Thou hast well said: for in matter of life, three acts is the whole play. Now to set a certain time to every man's acting, belongs unto him only, who as first he was of thy composition, so is now the cause of thy dissolution. As for thyself; thou hast to do with neither. Go thy ways then well pleased and contented: for so is He that dismisseth thee.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n\nCORRESPONDENCE OF M. AURELIUS ANTONINUS AND M. CORNELIUS FRONTO\n\n\nM. CORNELIUS FRONTO(1) was a Roman by descent, but of provincial birth, being native to Cirta, in Numidia. Thence he migrated to Rome in the reign of Hadrian, and became the most famous rhetorician of his day. As a pleader and orator he was counted by his contemporaries hardly inferior to Tully himself, and as a teacher his aid was sought for the noblest youths of Rome. To him was entrusted the education of M. Aurelius and of his colleague L. Verus in their boyhood; and he was rewarded for his efforts by a seat in the Senate and the consular rank (A.D. 143). By the exercise of his profession he became wealthy; and if he speaks of his means as not great,(2) he must be comparing his wealth with the grandees of Rome, not with the ordinary citizen. Before the present century nothing was known of the works of Fronto, except a grammatical treatise; but in 1815 Cardinal Mai published a number of letters and some short essays of Fronto, which he had discovered in a palimpsest at Milan. Other parts of the same MS. he found later in the Vatican, the whole being collected\n\n(1) References are made to the edition of Naber, Leipzig (Trübner), 1867. (2) Ad Verum imp. Aur. Caes., ii, 7.\n\nand edited in the year 1823. We now possess parts of his correspondence with Antoninus Pius, with M. Aurelius, with L. Verus, and with certain of his friends, and also several rhetorical and historical fragments. Though none of the more ambitious works of Fronto have survived, there are enough to give proof of his powers. Never was a great literary reputation less deserved. It would be bard to conceive of anything more vapid than the style and conception of these letters; clearly the man was a pedant without imagination or taste. Such indeed was the age he lived in, and it is no marvel that he was like to his age. But there must have been more in him than mere pedantry; there was indeed a heart in the man, which Marcus found, arid he found also a tongue which could speak the truth. Fronto's letters are by no means free from exaggeration and laudation, but they do not show that loathsome flattery which filled the Roman court. He really admires what he praises, and his way of saying so is not unlike what often passes for criticism at the present day. He is not afraid to reprove what he thinks amiss; and the astonishment of Marcus at this will prove, if proof were needed, that he was not used to plain dealing. \"How happy I am,\" he writes, \"that my friend Marcus Cornelius, so distinguished as an orator and so noble as a man, thinks me worth praising and blaming.\"(1) In another place he deems himself blest because Pronto had taught him to speak the truth(2) although the context shows him to be speaking of expression, it is still a point in favour of Pronto. A sincere heart is better than literary taste; and if Fronto had not done his duty by the young prince, it is not easy to understand the friendship which remained between them up to the last. An example of the frankness which was between them is given by a difference they had over the case of Herodes Atticus. Herodes was a Greek rhetorician who had a school at Rome, and Marcus Aurelius was among his pupils. Both Marcus and the Emperor (1) Ad M. Caes iii. 17 (2) Ad M. Caes iii. 12\n\nAntoninus had a high opinion of Herodes; and all we know goes to prove he was a man of high character and princely generosity. When quite young he was made administrator of the free cities in Asia, nor is it surprising to find that he made bitter enemies there; indeed, a just ruler was sure to make enemies. The end of it was that an Athenian deputation, headed by the orators Theodotus and Demostratus, made serious accusations against his honour. There is no need to discuss the merits of the case here; suffice it to say, Herodes succeeded in defending himself to the satisfaction of the emperor. Pronto appears to have taken the delegates' part, and to have accepted a brief for the prosecution, urged to some extent by personal considerations; and in this cause Marcus Aurelius writes to Fronto as follows\n\n'AURELIUS CAESAR to his friend FRONTO, greeting.(1)\n\n'I know you have often told me you were anxious to find how you might best please me. Now is the time; now you can increase my love towards you, if it can be increased. A trial is at hand, in which people seem likely not only to hear your speech with pleasure, but to see your indignation with impatience. I see no one who dares give you a hint in the matter; for those who are less friendly, prefer to see you act with some inconsistency; and those who are more frIendly, fear to seem too friendly to your opponent if they should dissuade you from your accusation; then again, in case you have prepared something neat for the occasion, they cannot endure to rob you of your harangue by silencing you. Therefore, whether you think me a rash counsellor, or a bold boy, or too kind to your opponent, not because I think it better, I will offer my counsel with some caution. But why have I said, offer my counsel? No, I demand it from you; I demand it boldly, and if I succeed, I promise to remain under your obligation. What? you will say if I am attackt, shall I not pay tit for tat ? Ah, but you will get greater glory, if even when attackt you answer nothing. Indeed, if he begins it, answer as you will and you will have fair excuse; but I have demanded of him that he shall not begin, and I think I have succeeded. I love each of you according to your merits and I know that lie was educated in the house of P. Calvisius, my gran(lfather, and that I was educated by you; therefore I am full of anxiety that this most disagreeable business shall be managed as honourably as possible. I trust you may approve my advice, for my intention you will approve. At least I prefer to write unwisely rather than to be silent unkindly.'\n\n(1) Ad M. Caes ii., 2.\n\nFronto replied, thanking the prince for his advice, and promising that he will confine himself to the facts of the case. But he points out that the charges brought against Herodes were such, that they can hardly be made agreeable; amongst them being spoliation, violence, and murder. However, he is willing even to let some of these drop if it be the prince's pleasure. To this Marcus returned the following answer:-(1) 'This one thing, my dearest Fronto, is enough to make me truly grateful to you, that so far from rejecting my counsel, you have even approved it. As to the question you raise in your kind letter, my opinion is this: all that concerns the case which you are supporting must be clearly brought forward ; what concerns your own feelings, though you may have had just provocation, should be left unsaid.'\n\nThe story does credit to both. Fronto shows no loss of temper at the interference, nor shrinks from stating his case with frankness; and Marcus, with forbearance remarkable in a prince, does not command that his friend be left unmolested, but merely stipulates for a fair trial on the merits of the case.\n\nAnother example may he given from a letter of Fronto's (2)\n\nHere is something else quarrelsome and querulous. I have sometimes found fault with you in your absence somewhat seriously in the company of a few of my most intimate friends : at times, for example, when you mixt in society with a more solemn look than was fitting, or would read books in the theatre or in a banquet ; nor did I absent myself from theatre or banquet when you did(3). Then I used to call you a hard man, no good company, even disagreeable, sometimes, when anger got the better of me. But did any one else in the same banquet speak against you, I could not endure to hear it with equanimity. Thus it was easier for me to say something to your disadvantage myself, than to hear others do it; just as I could more easily bear to chastise my daughter Gratia, than to see her chastised by another.'\n\n1. Ad. M. Caes., iii. 5. 2. iv. 12. 3 The text is obscure\n\nThe affection between them is clear from every page of the correspondence. A few instances are now given, which were written at different periods\n\nTo MY MASTER.(1)\n\n'This is how I have past the last few days. My sister was suddenly seized with an internal pain, so violent that I was horrified at her looks; my mother in her trepidation on that account accidentally bruised her side on a corner of the wall; she and we were greatly troubled about that blow. For myself; on going to rest I found a scorpion in my bed; but I did not lie down upon him, I killed him first. If you are getting on better, that is a consolation. My mother is easier now, thanks be to God. Good-bye, best and sweetest master. My lady sends you greeting.'\n\n(2)'What words can I find to fit my had luck, or how shall I upbraid as it deserves the hard constraint which is laid upon me? It ties me fast here, troubled my heart is, and beset by such anxiety; nor does it allow me to make haste to my Fronto, my life and delight, to be near him at such a moment of ill-health in particular, to hold his hands, to chafe gently that identical foot, so far as may be done without discomfort, to attend him in the bath, to support his steps with my arm.' (3)'This morning I did not write to you, because I heard you were better, and because I was myself engaged in other business, and I cannot ever endure to write anything to you unless with mind at ease and untroubled and free. So if we are all right, let me know: what I desire, you know, and how properly I desire it, I know. Farewell, my master, always in every chance first in my mind, as you deserve to be. My master, see I am not asleep, and I compel myself to sleep, that you may not be angry with me. You gather I am writing this late at night.'\n\n(1) Ad M. Caes., v. 8. (2) i. 2. (3) iii. 21.\n\n(1)'What spirit do you suppose is in me, when I remember how long it is since I have seen you, and why I have not seen you 1 and it may be I shall not see you for a few days yet, while you are strengthening yourself; as you must. So while you lie on the sick-bed, my spirit also will lie low anti, whenas,(2) by God's mercy you shall stand upright, my spirit too will stand firm, which is now burning- with the strongest desire for you. Farewell, soul of your prince, your\n\n(3)O my dear Fronto, most distinguished Consul! I yield, you have conquered: all who have ever loved before, you have conquered out and out in love's contest. Receive the victor's wreath ; and the herald shall proclaim your victory aloud before your own tribunal: \"M. Cornelius Fronto, Consul, wins, and is crowned victor in the Open International Love-race.\"(4) But beaten though I may be, I shall neither slacken nor relax my own zeal. Well, you shall love me more than any man loves any other man; but I, who possess a faculty of loving less strong, shall love you more than any one else loves you; more indeed than you love yourself. Gratia and I will have to fight for it; I doubt I shall not get the better of her. For, as Plautus says, her love is like rain, whose big drops not only penetrate the dress, but drench to the very marrow.'\n\nMarcus Aurelius seems to have been about eighteen years of age when the correspondence begins, Fronto being some thirty years older.(5) The systematic education of the young prince seems to have been finisht, and Pronto now acts more as his adviser than his tutor. He recommends the prince to use simplicity in his public speeches, and to avoid affectation.(6) Marcus devotes his attention to the old authors who then had a great vogue at Rome: Ennius, Plautus, Nawius, and such orators as Cato and Gracchus.(7) Pronto urges on him the study of Cicero, whose letters, he says, are all worth reading.\n\n1 Ad M. Caes., iii. 19. 2 The writer sometimes uses archaisms such as quom, which I render 'whenas. 3 Ad M. Caes., ii. 2. 4 The writer parodies the proclamation at the Greek games; the words also are Greek. 5 From internal evidence: the letters are not arranged in order of time. See Naher's Prolegomena, p. xx. foil. 6 Ad M. Caes., iii. x. 7 Ad M. Caes ii. 10,; iii. 18,; ii. 4.\n\nWhen he wishes to compliment Marcus he declares one or other of his letters has the true Tullian ring. Marcus gives his nights to reading when he ought to be sleeping. He exercises himself in verse composition and on rhetorical themes.\n\n'It is very nice of you,' he writes to Fronto,(1) 'to ask for my hexameters ; I would have sent them at once if I had them by me. The fact is my secretary, Anicetus-you know who I mean-did not pack up any of my compositions for me to take away with me. He knows my weakness; he was afraid that if I got hold of them I might, as usual, make smoke of them. However, there was no fear for the hexameters. I must confess the truth to my master: I love them. I study at night, since the day is taken up with the theatre. I am weary of an evening, and sleepy in the daylight, and so I don't do much. Yet I have made extracts from sixty books, five volumes of them, in these latter days. But when you read remember that the \"sixty\" includes plays of Novius, and farces, and some little speeches of Scipio; don't be too much startled at the number. You remember your Polemon; but I pray you do not remember Horace, who has died with Pollio as far as I am concerned.(2) Farewell, my dearest and most affectionate friend, most distinguished consul and my beloved master, whom I have not seen these two years. Those who say two months, count the days. Shall I ever see you again?'\n\nSometimes Fronto sends him a theme to work up, as thus: 'M. Lucilius tribune of the people violently throws into prison a free Roman citizen, against the opinion of his colleagues who demand his release. For this act he is branded by the censor. Analyse the case, and then take both sides in turn, attacking and defending.'(3) Or again: 'A Roman consul, doffing his state robe, dons the gauntlet and kills a lion amongst the young men at the Quinquatrus in full view of the people of Rome. Denunciation before the censors.'(4) The prince has a fair knowledge of Greek, and quotes from\n\n1 Ad M. Caes., ii. 10. 2 He implies, as in i. 6, that he has ceased to study Horace. 3 Pollio was a grammarian, who taught Marcus. 4 Ad M. Caes., v. 27,; V. 22.\n\nHomer, Plato, Euripides, but for some reason Fronto dissuaded him from this study.(5) His Meditations are written in Greek. He continued his literary studies throughout his life, and after he became emperor we still find him asking his adviser for copies of Cicero's Letters, by which he hopes to improve his vocabulary.(6) Pronto Helps him with a supply of similes, which, it seems, he did not think of readily. It is to be feared that the fount of Marcus's eloquence was pumped up by artificial means.\n\n1 Ad M. Caes., ii. 10. 2 He implies, as in i. 6, that he has ceased to study Horace. 3 Pollio was a grammarian, who taught Marcus. 4 Ad M. Caes., v. 27,; V. 22. 5 Ep. Gracae, 6. 6 Ad Anton. Imp., 1I. 4.\n\nSome idea of his literary style may he gathered from the letter which follows:(1)\n\n'I heard Polemo declaim the other day, to say something of things sublunary. If you ask what I thought of him, listen. He seems to me an industrious farmer, endowed with the greatest skill, who has cultivated a large estate for corn and vines only, and indeed with a rich return of fine crops. But yet in that land of his there is no Pompeian fig or Arician vegetable, no Tarentine rose, or pleasing coppice, or thick grove, or shady plane tree; all is for use rather than for pleasure, such as one ought rather to commend, but cares not to love. A pretty bold idea, is it not, and rash judgment, to pass censure on a man of such reputation? But whenas I remember that I am writing to you, I think I am less bold than you would have me. 'In that point I am wholly undecided. 'There's an unpremeditated hendecasyllable for you. So before I begin to poetize, i'll take an easy with you. Farewell, my heart's desire, your Verus's best beloved, most distinguisht consul, master most sweet. Farewell I ever pray, sweetest soul. What a letter do you think you have written me I could make bold to say, that never did she who bore me and nurst me, write anything SO delightful, so honey-sweet. And this does not come of your fine style and eloquence: otherwise not my mother only, but all who breathe.'\n\n1 Ad M. Caes, ii. 5.\n\nTo the pupil, never was anything on earth so fine as his master's eloquence ; on this theme Marcus fairly bubbles over with enthusiasm.\n\n(1)'Well, if the ancient Greeks ever wrote anything like this, let those who know decide it: for me, if I dare say so, I never read any invective of Cato's so fine as your encomtum. O if my Lord(2) could be sufficiently praised, sufficiently praised he would have been undoubtedly by you! This kind of thing is not done nowadays.(3) It were easier to match Pheidias, easier to match Apelles, easier in a word to match Demosthenes himself, or Cato himself; than to match this finisht and perfect work. Never have I read anything more refined, anything more after the ancient type, anything more delicious, anything more Latin. O happy you, to be endowed with eloquence so great! O happy I, to be tinder the charge of such a master! O arguments,(4) O arrangement, O elegance, O wit, O beauty, O words, O brilliancy, O subtilty, O grace, O treatment, O everything! Mischief take me, if you ought not to have a rod put in your hand one day, a diadem on your brow, a tribunal raised for you; then the herald would summon us all-why do I say \"us\"? Would summnon all, those scholars and orators: one by one you would beckon them forward with your rod and admonish them. Hitherto I have had no fear of this admonition; many things help me to enter within your school. I write this in the utmost haste; for whenas I am sending you so kindly a letter from my Lord, what needs a longer letter of mine? Farewell then, glory of Roman eloquence, boast of your friends, magnifico, most delightful man, most distinguished consul, master most sweet. 'After this you will take care not to tell so many fibs of me, especially in the Senate. A monstrous fine speech this is! O if I could kiss your head at every heading of it! You have looked down on all with a vengeance. This oration once read, in vain shall we study, in vain shall we toil, in vain strain every nerve. Farewell always, most sweet master.'\n\n1 Ad M. Caes., ii. 3. 2 The Emperor Antoninus Pius is spoken of as dominus vieus. 3 This sentence is written in Greek. 4 Several of these words are Greek, and the meaning is not quite clear.\n\nSometimes Fronto descends from the heights of eloquence to offer practical advice; as when he suggests how Marcus should deal with his suite. It is more difficult, he admits, to keep courtiers in harmony than to tame lions with a lute; but if it is to be done, it must be by eradicating jealousy. ' Do not let your friends,' says Fronto,'(1) 'envy each other, or think that what you give to another is filched from them. Keep away envy from your suite, and you will find your friends kindly and harmonious.'\n\nHere and there we meet with allusions to his daily life, which we could wish to be more frequent. He goes to the theatre or the law-courts,(2) or takes part in court ceremony, but his heart is always with his books. The vintage season, with its religious rites, was always spent by Antoninus Pius in the country. The following letters give sonic notion of a day's occupation at that time:(3)\n\n'MY DEAREST MASTER, -I am well. To-day I studied from the ninth hour of the night to the second hour of day, after taking food. I then put on my slippers, and from time second to the third hour had a most enjoyable walk up and down before my chamber. Then booted and cloaked-for so we were commanded to appear-I went to wait upon my lord the emperor. We went a-hunting, did doughty deeds, heard a rumour that boars had been caught, but there was nothing to see. However, we climbed a pretty steep hill, and in the afternoon returned home. I went straight to my books. Off with the boots, down with the cloak; I spent a couple of hours in bed. I read Cato's speech on the Property of Pulchra, and another in which he impeaches a tribune. Ho, ho! I hear you cry to your man, Off with you as fast as you can, and bring me these speeches from the library of Apollo. No use to send: I have those books with me too. You must get round the Tiberian librarian; you will have to spend something on the matter; and when I return to town, I shall expect to go shares with him. Well, after reading these speeches I wrote a wretched trifle, destined for drowning or burning. No, indeed my attempt at writing did not come off at all to-day; the composition of a hunter or a vintager, whose shouts are echoing through my chamber, hateful and wearisome as the law-courts. What have I said? Yes, it was rightly said, for my master is an orator. I think I have caught cold, whether from walking in slippers or from writing badly, I do not know. I am always annoyed with phlegm, but to-day I seem to snivel more than usual. Well, I will pour oil on my head and go off to sleep. I don't mean to put one drop in my lamp to-day, so weary am I from riding and sneezing. Farewell, dearest and most beloved master, whom I miss, I may say, more than Rome it~dL'\n\n1 Ad M Caes., iv. 1. 2 ii. 14 3 iv. 5,6.\n\n'MY BELOVED MASTER,-I am well. I slept a little more than usual for my slight cold, which seems to be well again. So I spent the time from the eleventh hour of the night to the third of the day partly in reading in Cato's Agriculture, partly in writing, not quite so badly as yesterday indeed. Then, after waiting upon my father, I soothed my throat with honey-water, ejecting it without swallowing: I might say gargle, but I won't, though I think the word is found in Novius and elsewhere. After attending to my throat I went to my father, and stood by his side as he sacrificed. Then to luncheon. What do you think I had to eat? A bit of bread so big, while I watched others gobbling boiled beans, onions, and fish full of roe. Then we set to work at gathering the grapes, with plenty of sweat and shouting, and, as the quotation runs, \"A few high-hanging clusters did we leave survivors of the vintage.\" After the sixth hour we returned home. I did a little work, and poor work at that. Then I had a long gossip with my dear mother sitting on the bed. My conversation was: What do you think my friend Fronto is doing just now? She said: And what do you think of my friend Gratia?'(1) My turn now: And what of our little Gratia,(2) the sparrowkin? After this kind of talk, and an argument as to which of you loved the other most, the gong sounded, the signal that my father had gone to the bath. We supped, after ablutions in the oil-cellar-I mean we supped after ablutions, not after ablutions in the oil-cellar; and listened with enjoyment to the rustics gibing. After returning, before turning on my side to snore, I do my task and give an account of the day to my delightful master, whom if I could long for a little more, I should not mind growing a trifle thinner. Farewell, Fronto, wherever you are, honey-sweet, my darling, my delight. Why do I want you? I can love you while far away.'\n\nOne anecdote puts Marcus before us in a new light:(3)\n\n1 Fronto's wife. 2 Fronto's daughter 3 Ad M. Caes ii. 12.\n\n'When my father returned home from the vineyards, I mounted my horse as usual, and rode on ahead some little way. Well, there on the road was a herd of sheep, standing all crowded together as though the place were a desert, with four dogs and two shepherds, but nothing else. Then one shepherd said to another shepherd, on seeing a number of horsemen: 'I say,' says he, 'look you at those horsemen; they do a deal of robbery.' When I heard this, I clap spurs to my horse, and ride straight for the sheep. In consternation the sheep scatter; hither and thither they are fleeting and bleating. A shepherd throws his fork, and the fork falls on the horseman who came next to me. We make our escape.'\n\nWe like Marcus none the worse for this spice of mischief. Another letter(1) describes a visit to a country town, and shows the antiquarian spirit of the writer\n\n'M. CAESAR to his MASTER M. FRONTO, greeting.\n\n'After I entered the carriage, after I took leave of you, we made a journey comfortable enough, but we had a few drops of rain to wet us. But before coming to the countryhouse, we broke our journey at Anagnia, a mile or so from the highroad. Then we inspected that ancient town, a miniature it is, but has in it many antiquities, temples, and religious ceremonies quite out of the way. There is not a corner without its shrine, or fane, or temple; besides, many books written on linen, which belongs to things sacred. Then on the gate as we came out was written twice, as follows : \"Priest don the fell.'(2) I asked one of the inhabitants what that word was. He said it was the word in the Hernican dialect for the victim's skin, which the priest puts over his conical cap when he enters the city. I found out many other things which I desired to know, but the only thing I do not desire is that you should he absent from me; that is my chief anxiety. Now for yourself, when you left that place, did you go to Aurelia or to Campania? Be sure to write to me, and say whether you have opened the vintage, or carried a host of books to the country-house; this also, whether you miss me; I am foolish to ask it, whenas you tell it me of yourself. Now if you miss me and if you love me, send me your letters often, which is a comfort and consolation to me. Indeed I should prefer ten times to read your letters than all the vines of Gaurus or the Marsians; for these Signian vines have grapes too rank and fruit too sharp in the taste, but I prefer wine to must for drinking. Besides, those grapes are nicer to eat dried than fresh-ripe; I vow I would rather tread them under foot than put my teeth in them. But I pray they may be gracious and forgiving, and grant me free pardon for these jests of mine. Farewell, best friend, dearest, most l~rned, sweetest master. When you see the must ferment in the vat, remember that just so in my heart the longing for you is gushing and flowing and bubbling. Good-bye.'\n\n1 Ad Verum. Imp ii. 1, s. fin. 2 Santentum\n\nMaking all allowances for conventional exaggerations, it is clear from the correspondence that there was deep love between Marcus and his preceptor. The letters cover several years in succession, but soon after the birth of Marcus's daughter, Faustina, there is a large gap. It does not follow that the letters ceased entirely, because we know part of the collection is lost; but there was probably less intercourse between Marcus and Fronto after Marcus took to the study of philosophy under the guidance of Rusticus. When Marcus succeeded to the throne in 161, the letters begin again, with slightly increased formality on Fronto's part, and they go on for some four years, when Fronto, who has been continually complaining of illhealth, appears to have died. One letter of the later period gives some interesting particulars of the emperor's public life, which are worth quoting. Fronto speaks of Marcus's victories and eloquence in the usual strain of high praise, and then continues.(1)\n\n'The army when you took it in hand was sunk in luxury and revelry, and corrupted with long inactivity. At Antiochia the soldiers had been Wont to applaud at the stage plays, knew more of the gardens at the nearest restaurant than of the battlefield. Horses were hairy from lack of grooming, horsemen smooth because their hairs had been pulled out by the roots(2) a rare thing it was to see a soldier with hair on arm or leg. Moreover, they were better drest than armed; so much so, that Laelianus Pontius. a strict man of the old discipline, broke the cuirasses of some of them with his finger-tips, and observed cushions on the horses' backs. At his direction the tufts were cut through, and out of the horsemnen's saddles came what appeared to be feathers pluckt from geese. Few of the men could vault on horseback, the rest clambered up with difficulty by aid of heel and knee and leg not many could throw a lance hurtling, most did it without force or power, as though they were things of wool. dicing was common in the camp, sleep lasted all night, or if they kept watch it was over the winecup. By what regulations to restrain such soldiers as these, and to turn them to honesty and industry, did you not learn from Hannibal's sternness, the discipline of Africanus, the acts of Metellus recorded in history\n\n1 Ad Verum. imp., ii. I, s.fin. 2 A common mark of the effeminate at Rome.\n\nAfter the preceptorial letters cease the others are concerned with domestic events, health and sickness, visits or introductions, birth or death. Thus the empperor writes to his old friend, who had shown some diffidence in seeking an interview :(1)\n\n'To MY MASTER.\n\n'I have a serious grievance against you, my dear master, yet indeed my grief is more than my grievance, because after so long a time I neither embraced you nor spoke to you, though you visited the palace, and the moment after I had left the prince my brother. I reproached my brother severc]y for not recalling me; nor durst he deny the fault.'\n\nFronto again writes on one occasion: 'I have seen your daughter. It was like seeing you and Faustina in infancy, so much that is charming her face has taken from each of yours.' Or again, at a later date:(2)\n\nI have seen your chicks, most delightful sight that ever I saw in my life, so like you that nothing is more like than the likeness. . . . By the mercy of Heaven they have a healthy colour and strong lungs. One held a piece of white bread, like a little prince, the other a common piece, like a true philosophers son.'\n\n1 Ad Verum. Imp. Aur. Caes., i. 3. 2 Ad Ant. Imp i., 3.\n\nMarcus, we know, was devoted to his children. They were delicate in health, in spite of Fronto's assurance, and only one son survived the father. We find echoes of this affection now and again in the letters.\n\n'We have summer heat here still,' writes Marcus, 'but since my little girls are pretty well, if I may say so, it is like the bracing climate of spring to us.'(1) When little Faustina came back from the valley of the shadow of death, her father at once writes to inform Fronto.(2) The sympathy he asks he also gives, and as old age brings more and more infirmity, Marcus becomes even more solicitous for his beloved teacher. The poor old man suffered a heavy blow in the death of his grandson, on which Marcus writes:(3) 'I have just heard of your misfortune. Feeling grieved as I do when one of your joints gives you pain, what do you think I feel, dear master, when you have pain of mind?' The old man's reply, in spite of a certain self-consciousness, is full of pathos. He recounts with pride the events of a long and upright life, in which he has wronged no man, and lived in harmony with his friends and family. His affectations fall away from him, as the cry of pain is forced from his heart:\n\n(4)'Many such sorrows has fortune visited me with all my life long. To pass by my other afflictions, I have lost five children under the most pitiful conditions possible: for the five I lost one by one when each was my only child, suffering these blows of bereavement in such a manner that each child was born to one already bereaved. Thus I ever lost my children without solace, and got them amidst fresh grief.....'\n\nThe letter continues with reflections on the nature of death, 'more to be rejoiced at than bewailed, the younger one dies,' and an arraignment of Providence not without dignity, wrung from him as it were by this last culminating misfortune. It concludes with a summing-up of his life in protest against the blow which has fallen on his grey head.\n\n1 Ad M. Caes., v. 19 2 iv. 11 3 De Nepote Amissa 4 De Nepote Amissa 2\n\n'Through my long life I have committed nothing which might bring dishonour, or disgrace, or shame: no deed of avarice or treachery have I done in all my day's: nay, but much generosity, much kindness, much truth and faithfulness have I shown, often at the risk of my own life. I have lived in amity with my good brother, whom I rejoice to see in possession of the highest office by your father's goodness, and by your friendship at peace and perfect rest. Th~ offices which I have myself obtained I never strove for by any underhand means. I have cultivated my mind rather than my body; the pursuit of learning I have preferred to increasing my wealth. I preferred to he poor rather than bound by any' man's obligation, even to want rather than to beg. I have never been extravagant in spending money, I have earned it sometimes because I must. I have scrupulously spoken the truth, and have been glad to hear it spoken to me. I have thought it better to be neglected than to fawn, to be dumb than to feign, to be seldom a friend than to be often a flatterer. 1 have sought little, deserved not little. So far as I could, I have assisted each according to my means. I have given help readily to the deserving, fearlessly to the undeserving. No one by proving to be ungrateful has made me more slow to bestow promptly all benefits I could give, nor have I ever been harsh to ingratitude. (A fragmentary passage follows, in which he appears to speak of his desire for a peaceful end, and the desolation of his house.) I have suffered long and painful sickness, my beloved Marcus. Then I was visited by pitiful misfortunes: my wife I have lost, my grandson I have lost in Germany:(1) woe is me! I have lost my Decimanus. If I were made of iron, at this tine I could write no more.'\n\nIt is noteworthy that in his meditations Marcus Aurelius mentions Fronto only once.(2) All his literary studies, his oratory and criticism (such as it was) is forgotten; and, says he, 'Fronto taught me not to expect natural affection from the highly-born.' Fronto really said more than this: that 'affection' is not a Roman quality, nor has it a Latin name.(3) Roman or not Roman, Marcus found affection in Fronto; and if he outgrew his master's intellectual training, he never lost touch with the true heart of the man it is that which Fronto's name brings up to his remembrance, not dissertations on compound verbs or fatuous criticisms of style.\n\n1 In the war against the Catti. 2 Book I., 8. 3 Ad Verum, ii. 7\n\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\nTHIS being neither a critical edition of the text nor an emended edition of Casaubon's translation, it has not been thought necessary to add full notes. Casaubon's own notes have been omitted, because for the most part they are discursive, and not necessary to an understanding of what is written. In those which here follow, certain emendations of his are mentioned, which he proposes in his notes, and follows in the translation. In addition, one or two corrections are made where he has mistaken the Greek, and the translation might be misleading. Those which do not come under these two heads will explain themselves.\n\nThe text itself has been prepared by a comparison of the editions of 1634 and 1635. It should he borne in mind that Casaubon's is often rather a paraphrase than a close translation; and it did not seem worth while to notice every variation or amplification of the original. In the original editions all that Casauhon conceives as understood, but not expressed, is enclosed in square brackets. These brackets are here omitted, as they interfere with the comfort of the reader; and so have some of the alternative renderings suggested by the translator. In a few cases, Latin words in the text have been replaced by English.\n\nNumbers in brackets refer to the Teubner text of Stich, but the divisions of the text are left unaltered. For some of the references identified I am indebted to Mr. G. H. Rendall's Marcus Aurelius.\n\nBOOK I\n\nI \"Both to frequent\" (4). Gr. to mh, C. conjectures to me.

If the received reading be right, it must be sarcastic; but there are several variants which show how unsatisfactory it is.

Life is not (v. 1. so) <long> for each, and this life for thee is all but done.\"\n\nX. \"honour and credit do proceed\" (12).

The face of Marcus is grave and sad. Behind him appears the praetorian prefect, Bassaeus Rufus. The composition of the work is fine and effective.

I have preferred to err, if error it be, on the side of over-faithfulness, because the physiognomy of the book owes so much to the method and style in which it is written. Its homeliness, abruptness, and want of literary finish (though it does not lack rhetoric) are part of the character of the work, and we alter this character by rewriting it into the terse, epigrammatic, staccato style so much in vogue at the present day. Another reason for literalness is that it makes a comparison with the Greek, printed beside it, easier for the unlearned. When a work has been translated so often as this one, it is difficult to be original without deviating further from the text, but I have not borrowed a phrase, scarcely a word, from any of my predecessors. If unconscious coincidences appear, it remains only to say \nPereant\n \n​\nqui ante nos nostra dixerint!\n Numerous references (such as have proved so invaluable for the due understanding of the Bible) and good indices have always been greatly wanted in the translations of this work, and I have taken pains to supply the want. For a better understanding of the character of Marcus I have added to the \nThoughts\n translations of his \nSpeeches\n and \nSayings\n, with a Note on his attitude towards the Christians (in which I am glad to find myself in complete agreement with M. Lemercier). A companion volume on the Correspondence with Fronto will contain all his extant Letters. In conclusion my best thanks are due to Messrs. Teubner for permission to use their text as the basis of the revised one here printed, to Professors Leopold and Schenkl for advice and help on various points, and, last but not least, to my predecessors in the translation of this \"Golden Book.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nC.

Maias in monte Caelio in hortis avo suo iterum et Augure consulibus. 6 Cuius familia in originem recurrens a Numa probatur sanguinem trahere, ut Marius Maximus docet; item a rege Sallentino Malemnio, Dasummi filio, qui Lopias condidit. 7 Educatus est in eo loco, in quo natus est, et in domo avi sui Veri iuxta aedes Laterani. 8 Habuit et sororem natu minorem Anniam Cornificiam, uxorem Anniam Faustinam, consobrinam suam. 9 Marcus Antoninus principio aevi sui nomen habuit Catilii Severi, materni proavi. 10 Post excessum vero patris ab Hadriano Annius Verissimus vocatus est, post virilem autem togam Annius Verus. patre mortuo ab avo paterno adoptatus et educatus est. \n\nII. 1 Fuit a prima infantia gravis. at ubi egressus est annos, qui nutricum foventur auxilio, magnis praeceptoribus traditus ad philosophiae scita pervenit. 2 Usus est magistris ad prima elementa Euforione litteratore et Gemino comoedo, musico Androne eodemque geometra. Quibus omnibus ut disciplinarum auctoribus plurimum detulit. 3 Usus praeterea grammaticis Graeco Alexandro Cotiaensi, Latinis Trosio Apro et Polione et Eutychio Proculo Siccensi. 4 Oratoribus usus est Graecis Aninio Macro, Caninio Celere et Herode Atti(o)co, Latino Frontone Cornelio. 5 Sed multum ex his Frontoni detulit, cui et statuam in senatu petit. Proculum vero usque ad proconsulatum provexit oneribus in se receptis. 6 Philosophiae operam vehementer dedit et quidem adhuc puer. Nam duodecimum annum ingressus habitum philosophi sumpsit et deinceps tolerantiam, cum studeret in pallio et humi cubaret, vix autem matre agente instrato pellibus lectulo accubaret. 7 Usus est etiam Commodo magistro, cuius ei adfinitas fuerat destinata, usus est et Apollonio Chalcedonio stoico philosopho. \n\nIII. 1 Tantum autem studium in eo philosophiae fuit, ut adscitus iam (in) imperatoriam tamen ad domum Apollonii discendi causa veniret. 2 Audivit et Sextum Chaeronensem Plutarchi nepotem, Iunium Rusticum, Claudium Maximum et Cinnam Catulum stoicos, 3 peripateticae vero studiosus audivit Claudium Severum, et praecipue Iunium Rusticum, quem et reveritus est et sectatus, qui domi militiaeque pollebat, stoicae disciplinae peritissimum; 4 cum quo omnia communicavit publica privataque consilia, cui etiam ante praefectos praetorio semper osculum dedit, quem et consulem iterum designavit, cui post obitum a senatu statuas postulavit. 5 Tantum autem honoris magistris suis detulit, ut imagines eorum aureas in larario haberet ac sepulchra eorum aditu, hostiis, floribus semper honoraret. 6 Studuit et iuri audiens Lucium Volusium Maecianum. 7 Tantumque operis et laboris studiis inpendit, ut corpus adficeret, atque in hoc solo pueritia eius reprehenderetur. 8 Frequentavit et declamatorum scolas publicas amavitque [ex] condiscipulis praecipuos senatorii ordinis Seium Fuscianum et Aufidium Victorinum, ex equestri Baebium Longum et Cal(l)enum. 9 In quos maxime liberalis fuit, et ita quidem ut, quos non posset ob qualitatem vitae rei p. praeponere, locupletatos teneret. \n\nIV. 1 Educatus est in Hadriani gremio, qui illum, ut supra diximus, Verissimum nominabat et qui ei honorem equi publici sexenni detulit, 2 octavo aetatis anno in saliorum collegium rettulit. 3 In saliatu omen accepit imperii: coronas omnibus in pulvinar ex more iacientibus aliae aliis locis haeserunt, huius velut manu capiti Martis aptata est. 4 Fuit in eo sacerdotio et praesul et vates et magister et multos inauguravit atque exauguravit nemine praeeunte, quod ipse carmina cuncta didicisset. 5 Virilem togam sumpsit quinto decimo aetatis anno, statimque ei Lucii Ceionii Commodi filia desponsata est ex Hadriani voluntate. 6 Nec multo post praefectus feriarum Latinarum fuit. In quo honore praeclarissime se pro magistratibus agentem et in conviviis Hadriani principis ostendit. 7 Post hoc patrimonium paternum sorori totum concessit, cum eum ad divisionem mater vocaret, responditque avi bonis se esse contentum, addens, ut et mater, si vellet, in sororem suum patrimonium conferret, ne inferior esset soror marito. 8 Fuit autem vitae indulgentia, ut cogeretur nonnumquam vel in venationes pergere vel in theatrum descendere vel spectaculis interesse. 9 Operam praeterea pingendo sub magistro Diogeneto dedit. Amavit pugilatum luctamina et cursum et aucupatus et pila lusit adprime et venatus est. 10 Sed ab omnibus his intentionibus studium eum philosophiae abduxit seriumque et gravem reddidit, non tamen prorsus abolita in eo comitate, quam praecipue suis, mox amicis atque etiam minus notis exhibebat, cum frugi esset sine contumacia, verecundus sine ignavia, sine tristitia gravis. \n\nV. 1 His ita se habentibus cum post obitum Lucii Caesaris Hadrianus successorem imperii quaereret, nec idoneus, utpote decem et octo annos agens, Marcus haberetur, amitae Marci virum Antoninum Pium Hadrianus ea lege in adoptationem legit, ut sibi Marcum Pius adoptaret, ita tamen ut et Marcus sibi Lucium Commodum adoptaret. 2 Sane ea die, qua adoptatus est, Verus in somnis se umeros eburneos habere vidit sciscitatusque, an apti essent oneri ferundo, solito repperit fortiores. 3 Ubi autem comperit se ab Hadriano adoptatum, magis est deterritus quam laetatus iussusque in Hadriani privatam domum migrare invitus de maternis hortis recessit. 4 Cumque ab eo domestici quaererent, cur tristis in adoptionem regiam transiret, disputavit, quae mala in se contineret imperium. 5 Tunc primum pro Annio Aurelius coepit vocari, quod in Aureliam, hoc est Antonini, adoptionis iure transisset. 6 Octavo decimo ergo aetatis anno adoptatus in secundo consulatu Antonini, iam patris sui, Hadriano ferente gratia aetatis facta questor est designatus. 7 Adoptatus in aulicam domum omnibus parentibus suis tantam reverentiam, quantam privatus exhibuit. 8 Eratque haut secus rei suae quam in privata domo parcus ac diligens, pro instituto patris volens agere, dicere, cogitare. \n\nVI. 1 Hadriano Baias absumpto cum Pius ad advehendas eius reliquias esset profectus, relictus Romae avo iusta implevit et gladiatorium quasi privatus quaestor edidit munus. 2 Post excessum Hadriani statim Pius per uxorem suam Marcum sciscitatus est et eum dissolutis sponsalibus, quae cum Lucii Ceionii Commodi - desponderi voluerat impari adhuc aetate, habita deliberatione velle se dixit. 3 His ita gestis adhuc quaestorem et consulem secum Pius Marcum designavit et Caesaris appellatione donavit et sevirum turmis equitum Romanorum iam consulem designatum creavit et edenti cum collegis ludos sevirales adsedit et in Tiberianam domum transgredi iussit et aulico fastigio renite[n]tem ornavit et in collegia sacerdotum iubente senatu recepit. 4 Secundum etiam consulem designavit, cum ipse quartum pariter inierit. 5 Per eadem tempora, cum tantis honoribus occuparetur et cum formandus ad regendum statum rei publicae patris actibus interesset, studia cupidissime frequentavit. 6 Post haec Faustinam duxit uxorem et suscepta filia tribunicia potestate donatus est atque imperio extra urbem proconsulari addito iure quintae relationis. 7 Tantum apud Pium valuit, [ut] numquam quemquam sine eo facile promoverit. 8 Erat autem in summis obsequiis patris Marcus, quamvis non deessent, qui aliqua adversum eum insusurrarent, 9 et prae ceteris Valerius Homullus, qui, cum Lucillam matrem Marci in virdiario venerantem simulacrum Apollinis vidisset, insusurravit: \"Illa nunc rogat, ut diem tuum claudas, et filius imperet\". quod omnino apud Pium nihil valuit: 10 tanta erat Marci probitas et tanta in imperatorio participatu modestia. \n\nVII. 1 Existimationis autem tantam curam habuit, ut et procuratores suos puer semper moneret, ne quid arrogantius facerent, et hereditatis delatas reddens proximis aliquando respuerit. 2 Denique per viginti et tres annos in domo patris ita versatus, ut eius cotidie amor cresceret, nec praeter duas noctes per tot annos ab eo mansit diversis vicibus. 3 Ob hoc Antoninus Pius, cum sibi adesse finem vitae videret, vocatis amicis et praefectis ut successorem eum imperii omnibus commendavit atque firmavit statimque signo aequanimitatis tribuno dato Fortunam auream, quae in cubiculo solebat esse, ad Marci cubiculum transire iussit. 4 Bonorum maternorum partem Mummio Quadrato, sororis filio, quia illa iam mortua erat, tradidit. 5 Post excessum divi Pii a senatu coactus regimen publicum capere fratrem sibi participem in imperio designavit, quem Lucium Aurelium Verum Commodum appellavit Caesaremque atque Augustum dixit. 6 Atque ex eo pariter coeperunt rem publicam regere. tuncque primum Romanum imperium duos Augustos habere coepit, [cum imperium sibi re]lictum cum alio participasset. Antonini mox ipse nomen recepit. 7 Et quasi pater Lucii Commodi esset, et Verum eum appellavit addito Antonini nomine filiamque suam Lucillam fratri despondit. 8 Ob hanc coniunctionem pueros et puellas novorum nominum frumentariae perceptioni adscribi praeceperunt actis igitur, quae agenda fuerant in senatu, 9 pariter castra praetoria petiverunt et vicena milia nummum singulis ob participatum imperium militibus promiserunt et ceteris pro rata. 10 Hadriani autem sepulcro corpus patris intulerunt magnifico exequiarum officio. mox iustitio secuto publici quoque funeris expeditus est ordo. 11 Et laudavere uterque pro rostris patrem flaminemque ei ex adfinibus et sodales ex amicissimis Aurelianos creavere. \n\nVIII. 1 Adepti imperium ita civiliter se ambo egerunt, ut lenitatem Pii nemo desideraret, cum eos Marullus, sui temporis mimografus, cavillando inpune perstringeret. 2 Funebre munus patri dederunt. 3 Dabat se Marcus totum et philosophiae, amorem civium adfectans. 4 Sed interpellavit istam felicitatem securitatemque imperatoris prima Tiberis inundatio, quae sub illis gravissima fuit. Quae res et multa urbis aedificia vexavit et plurimum animalium interemit et famem gravissimam peperit. 5 Quae omnia mala Marcus et Verus sua cura et praesentia temperarunt. 6 Fuit eo tempore etiam Parthicum bellum, quod Vologessus paratum sub Pio Marci et Veri tempore indixit fugato Atidio Corneliano, qui Syriam tunc administrabat. 7 Imminebat etiam Brittanicum bellum, et Catthi in Germaniam ac Raetiam inruperant. 8 Et adversus Brittannos quidem Calpurnius Agricola missus est, contra Catthos Aufidius Victorinus. 9 Ad Parthicum vero bellum senatu consentiente Verus frater est missus; ipse Romam remansit, quod res urbanae imperatoris presentiam postularent. 10 Et Verum quidem Marcus Capuam usque prosecutus amicis comitantibus a senatu ornavit additis officiorum omnium principibus. 11 Sed cum Romam redisset Marcus cognovissetque Verum apud Canusium aegrotare, ad eum videndum contendit susceptis in senatu votis; quae, posteaquam Romam redit audita Veri transmissione, statim red[d]idit. 12 Et Verus quidem, posteaquam in Syriam venit, in deliciis apud Antiochiam et Daphnen vixit armisque se gladiatoriis et venatibus exercuit, cum per legatos bellum Parthicum gerens imperator appellatus esset, 13 cum Marcus horis omnibus rei publicae actibus incubaret patienterque delicias fratris et prope [non] invitus ac volens ferret. 14 Denique omnia, quae ad bellum erant necessaria, Romae positus et disposuit Marcus et ordinavit. \n\nIX. 1 Gestae sunt res in Armenia prospere per Statium Priscum Artaxatis captis, delatumque Armeniacum nomen utrique principum. quod Marcus per verecundiam primo recusavit, postea tamen recepit. 2 Profligato autem bello uterque Parthicus appellatus est. Sed [id] quoque Marcus delatum nomen repudiavit, quod postea recepit. 3 Patris patriae autem nomen delatum (a) fratre absente in eiusdem praesentiam distulit. 4 Medio belli tempore et Civicam, patruum Veri, et filiam suam nupturam commissam sorori suae eandemque locupletatam Brundisium usque deduxit, ad eum misit Romamque statim rediit, 5 revocatus eorum sermonibus, qui dicebant Marcum velle finiti belli gloriam sibimet vindicare atque idcirco in Syriam proficisci. 6 Ad proconsules scribsit, ne quis filiae suae iter facienti occurreret. 7 Inter haec liberales causas ita munivit, ut primus iuberet apud praefectos aerarii Saturni unumquemque civium natos liberos profiteri intra tricensimum diem nomine imposito. 8 Per provincias tabulariorum publicorum usum instituit, apud quos idem de originibus fieret, quod Romae apud praefectos aerarii, ut, si forte aliquis in provincia natus causam liberalem diceret, testationes inde ferret. 9 Atque hanc totam legem de adsertionibus firmavit aliasque de mensariis et auctionibus tulit. \n\nX. 1 Senatum multis cognitionibus et maxime ad se pertinentibus iudicem dedit. de statu etiam defunctorum intra quinquennium quaeri iussit. 2 Neque quisquam principum amplius senatui detulit. in senatus autem honorificentiam multis praetoriis et consularibus privatis decidenda negotia delegavit, quo magis eorum cum exercitio iuris auctoritas cresceret. 3 Multos ex amicis in senatum adlegit cum aediliciis aut praetoriis dignitatibus. 4 Multis pauperibus sine crimine senatoribus dignitates tribunicias aediliciasque concessit. 5 Nec quemquum in ordinem legit, nisi quem ipse bene scisset. 6 Hoc quoque senatoribus detulit, ut, quotiens de quorum capite esset iudicandum, secreto pertractaret atque ita in publicum proderet nec pateretur (a)equites Romanos talibus interesse causis. 7 Semper autem, cum potuit, interfuit senatui, etiamsi nihil esset referendum, si Romae fuit; si vero aliquid referre voluit, etiam de Campania ipse venit. 8 Comitiis praeterea etiam usque ad noctem frequenter interfuit neque umquam recessit de curia, nisi consul dixisset : \"Nihil vos moramur, p. c.\" 9 Senatum appellationibus a consule factis iudicem dedit. 10 Iudicariae rei singularem diligentiam adhibuit. Fastis dies iudiciarios addidit, ita ut ducentos triginta dies annuos rebus agendis litibusque disceptandis constitueret. 11 Praetorem tutelarem primus fecit, cum ante tutores a consulibus poscerentur, ut diligentius de tutoribus tractaretur. 12 De curatoribus vero, cum ante non nisi ex lege Laetoria vel propter lasciviam vel propter dementiam darentur, ita statuit, ut omnes adulti curatores acciperent non redditis causis. \n\nXI. 1 Cavit et sumptibus publicis et calumniis quadruplatorum intercessit adposita falsis delatoribus nota. 2 Delationes, quibus fiscus augeretur, contempsit. De alimentis publicis multa prudentur invenit. curatores multis civitatibus, quo latius senatorias tenderet dignitates, a senatu dedit. 3 Italicis civitatibus famis tempore frumentum ex urbe donavit omnique frumentariae rei consuluit. 4 Gladiatoria spectacula omnifariam temperavit. temperavit etiam scaenicas donationes iubens, ut quinos aureos scaenici acciperent, ita tamen ut nullus editor decem aureos egrederetur. 5 Vias etiam urbis atque itinerum diligentissime curavit. Rei frumentariae graviter providit. 6 Datis iuridicis Italiae consuluit ad id exemplum, quo Hadrianus consulares viros reddere iura praeceperat 7 Hispanis exhaustis Italica allectione contra ... Traianique praecepta verecunde consuluit. 8 Leges etiam addidit de vicensima hereditatum, de tutelis libertorum, de bonis maternis et item de filiorum successionibus pro parte materna, utqu(a)e senatores peregrini quartam partem in Italia possiderent. 9 Dedit praeterea curatoribus regionum ac viarum potestatem, ut vel punirent vel ad praefectum urbi puniendos remitterent eos, qui ultra vectigalia quicquam ab aliquo exegissent. 10 Ius autem magis vetus restituit quam novum fecit. habuit secum praefectos, quorum et auctoritate et periculo semper iura dictavit. usus autem est Scaevola praecipue iuris perito. \n\nXII. 1 Cum populo autem non aliter egit, quam est actum sub civitate libera. 2 Fuitque per omnia moderantissimus in hominibus deterrendis a malo, invitandis ad bona, remunerandis copia, indulgentia liberandis fecitque ex malis bonos, ex bonis optimos, moderate etiam cavillationes nonnullorum ferens. 3 Nam cum quendam Vetrasinum famae detestandae honorem petentem moneret, ut se ab opinionibus populi vindicaret, et ille contra respondisset multos, qui secum in harena pugnassent, se praetores videre, patienter tulit. 4 Ac ne in quenquam facile vindicaret, praetorem, qui quaedam pessime egerat, non abdicare se praetura iussit, sed collegae iuris dictionem mandavit. 5 Fisco in causis conpendii numquam iudicans favit. 6 Sane, quamvis esset constans, erat etiam verecundus. 7 Posteaquam autem e Syria victor rediit frater, patris patriae nomen ambobus decretum est, cum se Marcus absente Vero erga omnes senatores atque homines moderatissime gessisset. 8 Corona praeterea civica oblata est ambobus; petitque Lucius, ut secum Marcus triumpharet. petit praetera Lucius, ut filii Marci Caesares appellarentur. 9 Sed Marcus tanta fuit moderatione, ut cum simul triumphasset, tamen post mortem Lucii tantum Germanicum se vocaret, quod sibi bello proprio pepererat. 10 In triumpho autem liberos Marci utriusque sexus secum vexerunt, ita tamen ut et puellas virgines veherent. 11 Ludos etiam ob triumphum decretos spectaverunt habitu triumphali. 12 Inter cetera pietatis eius haec quoque moderatio praedicanda est: funambulis post puerorum lapsum culcitas subici iussit. Unde hodieque rete praetenditur. 13 Dum Parthicum bellum geritur, natum est Marcomannicum, quod diu eorum, qui aderant, arte suspensum est, ut finito iam orientali bello Marcomannicum agi posset. 14 Et cum famis tempore populo insinuasset de bello, fratre post quinquennium reverso in senatu egit, ambos necessarios dicens bello Germanico imperatores. \n\nXIII. 1 Tantus autem timor belli Marcomannici fuit, ut undique sacerdotes Antoninus acciverit, peregrinos ritus impleverit, Romam omni genere lustraverit; 2 retardatusque bellica profectione sic celebravit et Romano ritu lectisternia per septem dies. 3 Tanta autem pestilentia fuit, ut vehiculis cadavera sint exportata serracisque. 4 Tunc autem Antonini leges sepeliendi sepulchrorumque asperrimas sanxerunt, quando quidem caverunt, ne quis [ubi] vellet fabricaretur sepulchrum. quod hodieque servatur. 5 Et multa quidem milia pestilentia consumpsit multosque ex proceribus, quorum amplissimis Antoninus statuas conlocavit. 6 Tantaque clementia fuit, ut et sumptu publico vulgaria funera iuberet (et) ecferri et vano cuidam, qui diripiendae urbis occasionem cum quibusdam consciis requirens de caprifici arbore in campo Martio contionabundus ignem de caelo lapsurum finemque mundi affore diceret, si ipse lapsus ex arbore in ciconiam verteretur, cum statuto tempore decidisset atque ex sinu ciconiam emisisset, perducto ad se atque confesso veniam daret. \n\nXIV. 1 Profecti tamen sunt paludati ambo imperatores et Victualis et Marcomannis cuncta turbantibus, aliis etiam gentibus, quae pulsae a superioribus barbaris fugerant, nisi reciperentur, bellum inferentibus. 2 Nec parum profuit ista profectio, cum Aquileiam usque venissent. Nam plerique reges et cum populis suis se retraxerunt et tumultus auctores interemerunt. 3 Quadi autem amisso rege suo non prius se confirmaturos eum, qui erat creatus, dicebant, quam id nostris placuisset imperatoribus. 4 Lucius tamen invitus profectus est, cum plerique ad legatos imperatorum mitterent defectionis veniam postulantes. 5 Et Lucius quidem, quod amissus esset praef. praetorio Furius Victorinus, atque pars exercitus interisset, redeundum esse) censebat; Marcus autem fingere barbaros aestimans et fugam et cetera, quae securitatem bellicam ostenderent, ob hoc ne tanti apparatus mole premerentur, instandum esse ducebat. 6 Denique transcensis Alpibus longius processerunt composueruntque omnia, quae ad munimen Italiae atque Illyrici pertinebant. 7 Placuit autem urgente Lucio, ut praemissis ad senatum litteris Lucius Romam rediret. 8 Biduoque, postquam iter ingressi sunt, sedens cum fratre in vehiculo Lucius apoplexi arreptus perit. \n\nXV. 1 Fuit autem consuetudo Marco, ut in circensium spectaculo legeret audiretque ac suscriberet. ex quo quidem saepe iocis popularibus dicitur lacessitus. 2 Multum sane potuerunt liberti sub Marco et Vero Geminus et Agaclytus. 3 Tantae autem sanctitatis fuit Marcus, ut Veri vitia et celaverit et defenderit, cum ei vehementissime displicerent, mortuumque eum divum appellaverit amitasque eius et sorores honoribus et salariis decretis sublevaverit atque provexerit sacrisque eum plurimis honoraverit. 4 Flaminem et Antoninianos sodales et omnes honores, qui divis habentur, eidem dedicavit. 5 Nemo est principum, quem non gravis fama perstringat, usque adeo ut etiam Marcus in sermonem venerit, quod Verum vel veneno ita tulerit, ut parte cultri veneno lita vulvam inciderit venenatam partem fratri edendam propinans et sibi innoxiam reservans, 6 vel certe per medicum Posidippum, qui ei sanguinem intempestive dicitur emisisse. Cassius post mortem Veri a Marco descivit. \n\nXVI. 1 Iam in suos tanta fuit benignitate Marcus, ut cum in omnes propin quos cuncta honorum ornamenta contulerit, tum in filium et Commodum quidem - scelestum atque inpurum - cito nomen Caesaris et mox sacerdotium statimque nomen imperatoris ac triumphi participationem et consulatum. 2 Quo quidem tempore sine - imperator filio ad triumphalem currum in circo pedes cucurrit. 3 Post Veri obitum Marcus Antoninus solus rem publicam tenuit, 4 multo melior et feracior ad virtutes, quippe qui nullis Veri iam impediretur aut simulatis callidae severitatis, qua ille ingenito vitio laborabat, erroribus aut his, quae praecipue displicebant Marco Antonino iam inde a primo aetatis suae tempore, vel institutis mentis pravae vel moribus. 5 Erat enim ipse tantae tranquillitatis, ut vultum numquam mutaverit maerore vel gaudio, philosophiae deditus stoicae, quam et per optimos quosque magistros acceperat et undique ipse collegerat. 6 Nam et Hadrianus hunc eundem successorem paraverat, nisi ei aetas puerilis obstitisset. 7 Quod quidem apparet ex eo, quod generum Pio hunc eundem delegit, ut ad eum, dignum utpote virum, quandocumque Romanum perveniret imperium. \n\nXVII. 1 Ergo provincias post haec ingenti moderatione ac benignitate tractavit. contra Germanos res feliciter gessit. 2 Speciale ipse bellum Marcomannicum, sed quantum nulla umquam memoria fuit, cum virtute tum etiam felicitate transegit, et eo quidem tempore, quo pestilentia gravis multa milia et popularium et militum interemerat. 3 Pannonias ergo Marcomannis, Sarmatis, V(u)andalis, simul etiam Quadis extinctis servitio liberavit et Romae cum Commodo, quem iam Caesarem fecerat, filio, ut diximus, suo, triumphavit. 4 Cum autem ad hoc bellum omne aerarium exhausisset suum neque in animum induceret, ut extra ordinem provincialibus aliquid imperaret, in foro divi Traiani auctionem ornamentorum imperialium fecit vendiditque aurea pocula et cristallina et murrina, vasa etiam regia et vestem uxoriam sericam et auratam, gemmas quin etiam, quas multas in repostorio sanctiore Hadriani reppererat. 5 Et per duos quidem menses haec venditio celebrata est, tantumque auri redactum, ut reliquias belli Marcomannici ex sententia persecutus postea dederit potestatem emptoribus, ut, si qui vellet empta reddere atque aurum recipere, sciret licere. Nec molestus ulli fuit qui vel non reddidit empta vel reddidit. 6 Tunc viris clarioribus permisit, ut eodem cultu quo et ipse vel ministris similibus convivia exhiberent. 7 In munere autem publico tam magnanimus fuit, ut centum leones una missione simul exhiberet (et) sagittis interfectos. \n\nXVIII. 1 Cum igitur in amore omnium imperasset atque ab aliis modo frater, modo pater, modo filius, ut cuiusque aetas sinebat, et diceretur et amaretur, octavo decimo anno imperii sui, sexagesimo et primo vitae, diem ultimum clausit. 2 Tantusque illius amor adeo die regii funeris claruit, ut nemo illum plangendum censuerit, certis omnibus, quod ab diis commodatus ad deos redisset. 3 Denique, priusquam funus conderetur, ut plerique dicunt, quod numquam antea factum fuerat neque postea, senatus populusque non divisis locis sed in una sede propitium deum dixit. 4 Hic sane vir tantus et talis ac diis vita et morte coniunctus filium Commodum dereliquit: qui si felix fuisset, filium non reliquisset. 5 Et parum sane fuit, quod illi honores divinos omnis aetas, omnis sexus, omnis conditio ac dignitas dedit, nisi quod etiam sacrilegus iudicatus est, qui eius imaginem in sua domo non habuit, qui per fortunam vel potuit habere vel debuit. 6 Denique hodieque in multis domibus Marci Antonini statuae consistunt inter deos penates. 7 Nec defuerunt homines qui somniis eum multa praedixisse augurantes futura et vera concinuerunt. 8 Unde etiam templum ei constitutum, dati sacerdotes Antoniniani et sodales et flamines et omnia, quae de sacratis decrevit antiquitas. \n\nXIX. 1 Aiunt quidam, quod et verisimile videtur, Commodum Antoninum, successorem illius ac filium, non esse de eo natum sed de adulterio, ac talem fabellam vulgari sermone contexunt. 2 Faustinam quondam, Pii filiam, Marci uxorem, cum gladiatores transire vidisset, unius ex his amore succensam, cum longa aegritudine laboraret, viro de amore confessam. 3 Quod cum ad Chaldaeos Marcus rettulisset, illorum fuisse consilium, ut occiso gladiatore sanguine illius sese Faustina sublavaret atque ita cum viro concumberet. 4 Quod cum esset factum, solutum quidem amorem, natum vero Commodum gladiatorem esse, non principem, 5 qui mille prope pugnas publice populo inspectante gladiatorias imperator exhibuit, ut in vita eius docebitur. 6 Quod quidem verisimile ex eo habetur, quod tam sancti principis filius his moribus fuit, quibus nullus lanista, nullus scaenicus, nullus arenarius, nullus postremo ex omnium decorum ac scelerum conluvione concretus. 7 Multi autem ferunt Commodum omnino ex adultero natum, si quidem Faustinam satis constet apud Caietam condiciones sibi et nauticas et gladiatorias elegisse. 8 De qua cum diceretur Antonino Marco, ut eam repudiaret, si non occideret, dixisse fertur : \"Si uxorem dimittimus, reddamus et dotem.\" 9 Dos autem quid habebatur [nisi] imperium, quod ille ab socero volente Hadriano adoptatus acceperat? 10 Tantum sane valet boni principis vita, sanctitas, tranquillitas, pietas, ut eius famam nullius proximi decoloret invidia. 11 Denique Antonino, cum suos mores semper teneret neque alicuius insusurratione mutaretur, non obfuit gladiator filius, uxor infamis : 12 deusque etiam nunc habetur, ut vobis ipsis, sacratissime imperator Diocletiane, et semper visum est et videtur, qui eum inter numina vestra non ut ceteros sed specialiter veneramini ac saepe dicitis vos vita et clementia tales esse cupere, qualis fuit Marcus, etiamsi philosophia nec Plato esse possit, si revertatur in vitam. Et quidem haec breviter et congeste. \n\nXX. 1 Sed Marco Antonino haec sunt gesta post fratrem: primum corpus eius Romam devectum est et inlatum maiorum sepulchris. Divini ei honores decreti. 2 Dein cum gratias ageret senatui, quod fratrem consecrasset, occulte ostendit omnia bellica consilia sua fuisse, quibus superati sunt Parthi. 3 Addidit praeterea quaedam, quibus ostendit nunc demum se quasi a principio acturum esse rem publicam amoto eo, qui remissior videbatur. 4 Nec aliter senatus accepit, quam Marcus dixerat, ut videretur gratias agere, quod Verus excessisset vita. 5 Omnibus deinde sororibus et adfinibus et libertis iuris et honoris et pecuniae plurimum detulit. erat enim famae suae curiosissimus, requirens ad verum, quid quisque de se diceret, emendans quae bene reprehensa viderentur. 6 Proficiscens ad bellum Germanicum filiam suam non decurso luctus tempore grandaevo equitis Romani filio Claudio Pompeiano dedit genere Antiochensi nec satis nobili (quem postea bis consulem fecit), cum filia eius Augusta esset et Augustae filia. 7 Sed has nuptias et Faustina et ipsa, quae dabatur, invitae habuerunt. \n\nXXI. 1 Cum Mauri Hispanias prope omnes vastarent, res per legatos bene gestae sunt. 2 Et cum per Aegyptum Bucolici(s) milites gravia multa fecissent, per Avidium Cassium retunsi sunt, qui postea tyrannidem arripuit. 3 Sub ipsis profectionis diebus in secessu Praenestino agens filium, nomine Verum Caesarem, execto sub aure tubere septennem amisit. 4 Quem non plus quinque diebus luxit consolatusque etiam medicos [se] actibus publicis reddidit. 5 Et quia ludi Iovis Optimi Maximi erant, interpellari eos publico luctu noluit iussitque, ut statuae tantum modo filio mortuo decernerentur, et imago aurea circensibus per pompam ferenda, et ut saliari carmini nomen eius insereretur. 6 Instante sane adhuc pestilentia et deorum cultum diligentissime restituit et servos, quem ad modum bello Punico factum fuerat, ad militiam paravit, quos voluntarios exemplo volonum appellavit. 7 Armavit etiam gladiatores, quos obsequentes appellavit. Latrones etiam Dalmatiae atque Dardaniae milites fecit. Armavit et diogmitas. emit et Germanorum auxilia contra Germanos. 8 Omni praaeterea diligentia paravit legiones ad Germanicum et Marcomannicum bellum. 9 Et, ne provincialibus esset molestus, auctionem rerum aulicarum, ut diximus, fecit in foro divi Traiani, in qua praeter vestes et pocula et vasa aurea etiam signa cum tabulis magnorum artificum vendidit. 10 Marcomannos in ipso transitu Danuvii delevit et praedam provincialibus reddidit. \n\nXXII. 1 Gentes omnes ab Illyrici limite usque in Galliam conspiraverant, ut Marcomanni, Varistae, Hermunduri et Quadi, Suevi, Sarmatae, Lacringes et Burei + hi aliique cum Victualis, Sosibes, Sicobotes Roxolani, Basternae, Halani, Peucini, Costoboci. Inminebat et Parthicum bellum et Brittanicum. 2 Magno igitur labore etiam duo gentes asperimas vicit militibus sese imitantibus, ducentibus etiam exercitum legatis et praefectis praetorio, accepitque in deditionem Marcomannos plurimis in Italiam traductis. 3 Semper sane cum optimatibus non solum bellicas res sed etiam civiles, priusquam faceret aliquid, contulit. 4 Denique sententia illius praecipua semper haec fuit : \"Aequius est, ut ego tot talium amicorum consilium sequar, quam ut tot tales amici meam unius voluntatem sequantur.\" 5 Sane quia durus videbatur ex philosophiae institutione Marcus ad militiae labores atque ad omnem vitam, graviter carpebatur, 6 sed male loquentum vel sermoni vel litteris respondebat. 7 Et multi nobiles bello Germanico sive Marcomannico immo plurimarum gentium interierunt - quibus omnibus statuas in foro Ulpio colloquavit -; 8 quare frequenter amici suaserunt, ut a bellis discederet [et] Romam veniret, sed ille contempsit ac perstitit nec prius recessit, quam omnia bella finiret. 9 Provincias ex proconsularibus consulares aut ex consularibus proconsulares aut praetorias pro belli necessitate fecit. 10 Res etiam in Sequanis turbatas censura et auctoritate repressit. 11 Compositae res et [in] Hispania, quae per Lusitaniam turbatae erant. 12 Filio Commodo accersito ad limitem togam virilem dedit, quare congiarium populo divisit, et eum ante tempus consulem designavit \n\nXXIII. 1 Si quis umquam proscriptus est a praefecto urbi, non libenter accepit. 2 Ipse in largitionibus pecuniae publicae parcissimus fuit, quod laudi potius datur quam reprehensioni, sed tamen et bonis viris pecunias dedit et oppidis labentibus auxilium tulit et tributa vel vectigalia, ubi necessitas cogebat, remisit. 4 Absens populi Romani voluptates curari vehementer praecepit per ditissimos editores. 5 Fuit enim populo hic sermo, cum sustulisset ad bellum gladiatores, quod populum sublatis voluptatibus vellet cogere ad philosophiam. 6 Iusserat enim, ne mercimonia impedirentur, tardius pantomimos exhiberi, non totis diebus. 7 De amatis pantomimis ab uxore fuit sermo, ut superius diximus. Sed haec omnia per epistolas suas purgavit. 8 Idem Marcus sederi in civitatibus vetuit in equis sive vehiculis. Lavacra mixta summovit. mores matronarum conposuit diffluentes et iuvenum nobilium. Sacra Serapis a vulgaritate Pelusiasca summovit. 9 Fama fuit sane, quod sub philosophorum specie quidam rem publicam vexarent et privatos. quod ille purgavit. \n\nXXIV. 1 Erat mos iste Antonino, ut omnia crimina minore supplicio, quam legibus plecti solent, punirent, quamvis nonnumquam contra manifestos et gravium criminum reos inexorabilis permaneret. 2 Capitales causas hominum honestorum ipse cognovit, et quidem summa aequitate, ita ut praetorem reprehenderet, qui cito reorum causas audierat, iuberetque illum iterum cognoscere, dignitatis eorum interesse dicens, ut ab eo audirentur, qui pro populo iudicaret. 3 Aequitatem autem etiam circa captos hostes custodivit. Infinitos ex gentibus in Romano solo collocavit. 4 Fulmen de caelo precibus suis contra hostium machinamentum extorsit suis pluvia impetrata, cum siti laborarent. 5 Voluit Marcomanniam provinciam, voluit etiam Sarmatiam facere, et fecisset, nisi Avidius Cassius rebellasset sub eodem in oriente. 6 Atque imperatorem se appellavit, ut quidam dicunt, Faustina volente, quae de mariti valetudine desperaret. 7 Alii dicunt, ementita morte Antonini Cassium imperatorem se appellasse, cum divum Marcum appellasset. 8 Et Antoninus quidem non est satis motus defectione Cassii nec [in] eius affectus saevit. 9 Sed per senatum hostis est iudicatus bonaque eius proscripta per aerarium publicum. \n\nXXV. 1 Relicto ergo Sarmatico Marcommannicoque bello contra Cassium profectus est. 2 Romae etiam turbae fuerunt, quasi Cassius absente Antonino adventaret. sed Cassius statim interfectus est, caputque eius adlatum est ad Antoninum. 3 Marcus tamen non exultavit interfectione Cassii caputque eius humari iussit. 4 Maecianum etiam, filium Cassii, cui Alexandria erat commissa, exercitus occidit; nam et praef(ectum) praet(orio) sibi fecerat, qui et ipse occisus est. 5 In conscios defectionis vetuit senatum graviter vindicare, 6 simul petit, ne qui senator tempore principatus sui occideretur, eius pollueretur imperium 7 - eos etiam, qui deportati fuerant, revocari iussit, - cum paucissimi centuriones capite essent puniti. 8 Ignovit et civitatibus, quae Cassio consenserant, ignovit et Antiochensibus, qui multa in Marcum pro Cassio dixerant. 9 Quibus et spectacula et conventus publicos tulerat et omnium contionum genus, contra quos edictum gravissimum misit. 10 Seditiosos autem eos et oratio Marci indicat indita a Mario Maximo, qua ille usus est apud amicos. 11 Denique noluit Antiochiam videre, cum Syriam peteret. 12 Nam nec Cyrrum voluit videre, ex qua erat Cassius. \n\nXXVI. 1 Fuit Alexandriae clementer cum his agens. Postea tamen Antiochiam vidit. multa egit cum regibus et pacem confirmavit sibi occurentibus cunctis regibus et legatis Persarum. 2 Omnibus orientalibus provinciis carissimus fuit. apud multas etiam philosophiae vestigia reliquit. 3 Apud Aegyptios civem se egit et philosophum in omnibus studiis, templis, locis. et cum multa Alexandrini in Cassium dixissent fausta, tamen omnibus ignovit et filiam suam apud eos reli(n)quit. 4 Faustinam suam in radicibus montis Tauri in vico Halalae exanimatam vi subiti morbi amisit. 5 Petit a senatu, ut honores Faustinae aedemque decernerent, laudata eadem, cum impudicitiae fama graviter laborasset. 6 Quae Antoninus vel nesciit vel dissimulavit. novas puellas Faustinianas instituit in honorem uxoris mortuae. 7 Divam etiam Faustinam a senatu appellatam gratulatus est. 8 Quam secum et in aestivis habuerat, ut matrem castrorum appellaret. 9 Fecit et coloniam vicum, in quo obiit Faustina, et aedem illi exstruxit. Sed haec postea aedis Heliogabalo dedicata est. 10 Ipsum Cassium pro clementia occisum passus est, non occidi iussit. 11 Deportatus est Heliodorus, filius Cassi, et alii liberum exilium acceperunt cum bonorum parte. 12 Filii autem Cassii et amplius media parte acceperunt paterni patrimonii, et auro atque argento adiuti, mulieres autem etiam ornamentis: ita ut Alexandria, filia Cassii, et Druncanius gener liberam vagandi potestatem haberent commendati amitae marito. 13 Doluit denique Cassium extinctum, dicens voluisse se sine senatorio sanguine imperium transigere (voluisse se). \n\nXXVII. 1 Orientalibus rebus ordinatis Athenis fuit et initialia Cereris adit, ut se innocentem probaret, et sacrarium solus ingressus est. 2 Revertens ad Italiam navigio tempestatem gravissimam passus est. 3 Per Brundisium veniens in Italia togam et ipse sumpsit et milites togatos esse iussit, nec umquam sagati fuerunt sub eo milites. 4 Romam ut venit, triumphavit et inde Lavinium profectus est. 5 Commodum deinde sibi collegam in tribuniciam potestatem iunxit, coniarium populo dedit et spectacula mirifica; dein civilia multa correxit. 6 Gladiatorii muneris sumptus modum fecit. 7 Sententia Platonis semper in ore illius fuit florere civitates, si aut philosophi imperarent aut imperantes philosopharentur. 8 Filio suo Brutii Praesentis filiam iunxit nuptiis celebratis exemplo privatorum, quare etiam congiarium dedit populo. 9 Dein ad conficiendum bellum conversus in administratione eius belli obit labentibus iam filii moribus ab instituto suo. 10 Triennio bellum postea cum Marcomannis, Hermunduris, Sarmatis, Quadis etiam egit et, si anno uno superfuisset, provincias ex his fecisset. 11 Ante biduum quam exspiraret, admissis amicis dicitur ostendisse sententiam de filio eandem quam Philippus de Alexandro, cum de male sentiret, addens minime se aegre ferre [quod moreretur, sed quod moreretur talem] filium superstitem relinquens; 12 nam iam Commodus turpem se et cruentum ostentabat. \n\nXXVIII. 1 Mors autem talis fuit: cum aegrotare coepisset, filium advocavit atque ab eo primum petit, ut belli reliquias non contempneret, ne videretur rem p. prodere. 2 Et, cum filius ei respondisset cupere se primum sanitatem, ut vellet, permisit, petens tamen, ut expectasset paucos dies, haut simul proficisceretur. 3 Deinde abstinuit victu potuque mori cupiens auxitque morbum. 4 Sexta die vocatis amicis et ridens res humanas mortem autem contempnens ad amicos dixit : \"Quid de me fletis et non magis de pestilentia et communi morte cogitatis?\" 5 Et cum illi vellent recedere, ingemescens ait : \"Si iam me dimittitis, vale vobis dico vos praecedens.\" 6 Et cum ab eo quaereretur, cui filium commendaret, ille respondit : \"Vobis, si dignus fuerit, et dis inmortalibus.\" 7 Exercitus cognita mala valetudine vehementissime dolebant, quia illum unice amarunt. 8 Septimo die gravatus est et solum filium admisit, quem statim dimisit, ne in eum morbus transiret. 9 Dimisso filio caput operuit quasi volens dormire, sed nocte animam efflavit. 10 fertur filium mori voluisse, cum eum talem videret futurum, qualis exstitit post eius mortem, ne, ut ipse dicebat, similis Neroni, Caligulae et Domitiano esset. \n\nXXIX. 1 Crimini ei datum est, quod adulteros uxoris promoverit, Tertullum et Tutilium et Orfitum et Moderatum, ad varios honores, cum Tertullum et prandentem cum uxore deprehenderit. 2 De quo mimus in scaena praesente Antonino dixit; cum stupidus nomen adulteri uxoris a servo quaereret et ille diceret ter \"Tullus\", et adhuc stupidus quaereret, respondit ille : \"Iam tibi dixi ter, Tullus dicitur.\" 3 Et de hoc quidem multa populus, multa etiam alii dixerunt patientiam Antonini incusantes. 4 ante tempus sane mortis, priusquam ad bellum Marcomannicum rediret, in Capitolio iuravit nullum senatorem se sciente occisum, cum etiam rebelliones dixerit se servaturum fuisse, si scisset; 5 nihil enim magis et timuit et deprecatus est quam avaritiae famam, de qua se multis epistulis purgat. 6 Dederunt ei vitio, quod et fictus fuisset nec tam simplex quam videretur aut quam vel Pius vel Verus fuisset. 7 Dederunt etiam crimini, quod aulicam adrogantiam confirmaverit summovendo amicos a societate communi et a conviviis. 8 Parentibus consecrationem decrevit. amicos parentum etiam mortuos statuis ornavit. 9 Suffragatoribus non cito credidit, sed semper diu quaesivit, quoderat verum. 10 Enisa est Fabia, ut Faustina mortua in eius matrimonium coiret. Sed ille concubinam sibi adscivit procuratoris uxoris suae filiam, ne tot liberis superduceret novercam.",

This book encompasses two main works: \"Meditations,\" which reflects Aurelius' personal thoughts and philosophical inquiries, and \"Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius,\" which provides further explorations of his ideas and principles. The overarching topic revolves around Stoic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... \n Read More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphilosophy, touching upon themes such as virtue, self-control, the transient nature of life, and the importance of rationality. The content within this collection presents a series of meditative reflections and philosophical discourses that highlight Aurelius' views on how to navigate the complexities of existence. The \"Meditations\" cover various subjects, including the significance of inner peace, the inevitability of death, and the nature of the universe as a cohesive whole. Through his introspective style, Aurelius emphasizes the necessity of embracing one’s fate and acting in accordance with nature while striving for personal growth and moral integrity. His thoughts consistently encourage readers to develop resilience and to find meaning in life’s challenges, fostering a deep understanding of one's role within the broader human experience.
