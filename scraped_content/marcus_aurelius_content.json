    "content": "←\nBook XII\nThe communings with himself of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus\n (\n1916\n)\nby \nMarcus Aurelius Antoninus\n, \ntranslated by \nCharles Reginald Haines\nThe Speeches of Marcus\nSayings\n→\nMarcus Aurelius Antoninus\n4465036\nThe communings with himself of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus\n — The Speeches of Marcus\n1916\nCharles Reginald Haines\n\n\nLayout 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n​\n \n\n\n\n\nTHE SPEECHES OF MARCUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n​\n\n\nTHE SPEECHES OF MARCUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus\n learnt from Rusticus to \"eschew rhetoric and fine language\"\n and thanked the Gods that \"he had not made more progress in his rhetorical studies,\"\n but the Greek in which he clothed his \nThoughts\n shews that he had made some progress in them, and Dio says he was \"practised in the principles of rhetoric.\"\n\n\nOnly three speeches, purporting to be by Marcus, have come down to us. It is not certain how far we can accept them as authentic. The first is reported by Dio Cassius, who was twenty at the time of its delivery, and as he lived at Rome, and afterwards held high office in the state, he had ample sources of information. He expressly states that Marcus read this address to the soldiers on the rebellion of Cassius, and being written it was more likely to have been preserved verbatim. It cannot be denied that the speech has touches characteristic of Marcus, but of course these might have been purposely introduced by a skilful forger. On the other hand the style is rather rhetorical and artificial and more in keeping with Dio's known proclivities. Still there is a dignity and restraint, not altogether unworthy of the occasion, noticeable throughout. Unfortunately it only comes to us in the epitome of Xiphilinus, and we do not know how far he has curtailed it, and it certainly seems \n​\ntoo short for such an occasion. In any case it must have been delivered in Latin.\n\nThe last remark applies also to the dying speech of Marcus as given by Herodian, another contemporary authority, but one who was fond of composing suitable speeches for his characters when what they had actually said was not recoverable. The shortness of this speech may be said to be in its favour, as the Emperor was in the last stages of his illness. The opening words are perhaps too plaintive and personal, but the remainder is natural and appropriate. The last few words of such a ruler and friend must have impressed his hearers and may well have been taken down at the time. Still it is strange that there is no hint of this speech in the description of the last scene given by Capitolinus.\n\n\nThe third speech, from the \"Life of Avidius Cassius\" by Gallicanus, is much less likely to be genuine. That particular piece of work is full of suspected material, and Marius Maximus, from whom this speech is probably taken, though a contemporary, is not a trustworthy authority, while the diction and absurd rhetoric of the missive, for it was a speech sent to the Senate and not delivered in it, are decidedly against its genuineness.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n​\n\n\nSpeech to the Army on the news of the Revolt of Cassius\n, 175 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus, learning of the revolt from Verus,\n the Governor of Cappadocia, kept the news secret for a time, but as the soldiers were both greatly perturbed by the rumour and were freely discussing it, he called them together and read the following speech:\n\n\"It is not, O fellow soldiers, to give way to resentment or lamentations that I am come before you. For what avails it to be wroth with the Divinity that can do whatever pleaseth Him? Still, perhaps, they that are undeservedly unfortunate cannot but bewail their lot; and that is the case with me now. For it is surely a terrible thing for us to be engaged in wars upon wars; surely it is shocking to be involved even in civil strife, and surely it is more than terrible and more than shocking that there is no faith to be found among men,\n and that I have been plotted against by one whom I held most dear and, although I had done no wrong and committed no transgression, have been forced into a conflict against my will.\n For what rectitude shall be held safe, what friendship be any longer deemed secure, seeing that this has befallen me? Has not Faith utterly perished,\n and good Hope perished with it? Yet I had counted it a slight thing, had the danger been mine alone—for assuredly I was not born immortal—but now that there has been a defection, or rather a revolt, in the state, and the war comes home to all of us equally, I would gladly, had it been possible, have invited Cassius to argue the question out before you or before the Senate, and willingly without a contest have made way for him in the supreme power, had that seemed expedient for the common weal. For it is only in the public interest that I continue to incur toil and danger, and have spent so much time here beyond the bounds of Italy, an old man as I now am\n \n​\nand an ailing,\n unable to take food without pain, or sleep without care.\n\n\"But since Cassius would never agree to meet me for this purpose for what faith could he have in me who kept so ill his faith to me?—you, my fellow soldiers, must in any case be of good cheer. For never, I take it, have Cilicians and Syrians and Jews and Egyptians been a match for you, and never will be, no, not though their muster was as many thousand times more numerous than yours as it is now less. Nor need even Cassius himself, ever so good a commander though he is reputed to be, and credited with many successful campaigns, be held of any great account at the present crisis. For an eagle at the head of daws makes no formidable foe, nor a lion at the head of fawns, and as for the Arabian war and the great Parthian war, it was you, not Cassius, who brought them to a successful end. Moreover, even if he has won distinction by his Parthian campaigns, you too have Verus,\n who has won not less but even far more victories, and made greater acquisitions than he.\n\n\"But perhaps even now, learning that I am alive, he has repented of his action; for surely it was only because he believed me dead, that he acted thus. But if he still maintain his opposition, yet when he learns that we are indeed marching against him, he will doubtless take a different view both from dread of you and from reverence for me. I at any rate, fellow soldiers, have but one fear—for I will tell you the whole truth—that either he should take his own life from very shame of coming into our presence, or that another should slay him, learning both that I shall come and that I am actually setting out against him. For great is the prize of war and of victory—a prize such as no one among men has ever won—of which I shall be deprived. And what is that? To forgive a man who has done wrong, to be still a friend to one who has trodden friendship underfoot, to continue faithful to one who has broken faith.\n What I say may perhaps seem to you incredible, but you must not disbelieve it; \n​\nfor, I take it, all that is good has not vanished utterly from among men, but there still remains among us a vestige of pristine virtue. But if any be incredulous, the greater even on that account is my desire that he should with his own eyes see actually done that which no man would believe could be done. For this would be the only gain I could get from my present troubles, if I were able to bring the matter to an honourable conclusion,\n and show to all the world that even civil war can be dealt with on right principles.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFrom a Speech of Marcus Antoninus (sent to the Senate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In return, then, for your congratulations on our victory, Conscript Fathers, you have as consul my son-in-law Pompeianus,\n whose mature years should long ago have been rewarded with a consulship had not other brave men had prior claims for recognition from the state. Now with regard to the rebellion of Cassius, I beg and beseech you, Conscript Fathers, to lay aside all thoughts of severity and safeguard my or rather your humanity and clemency, and let no single person be put to death by the Senate. Let no Senator be punished, the blood of no man of noble birth be spilt; let the exiles return, the proscribed recover their goods. Would that I could recall the condemned also from the Shades! For revenge for his own wrongs never sits well on an emperor; the more it is deserved, the more severe it seems. So you must pardon the sons of Avidius Cassius, and his son-in-law, and his wife. But why do I say \"pardon,\" since \nthey\n have done no wrong? Let them live, then, in security, knowing that they live under Marcus. Let them live on their patrimony proportionately divided;\n let them enjoy their gold, their silver, their raiment; \n​\nlet them be unmolested, let them be free to come and go as they please, and let them bear witness among all peoples everywhere to my humanity and yours. Nor is this any great clemency, O Conscript Fathers, that the children and wives of the proscribed should be pardoned: but what I ask of you is that you should shield all accomplices of Cassius among the Senators or Knights from death, proscription, apprehension, degradation, hatred, and in fact from all injury,\n and grant this glory to my reign, that in a rebellion against the throne death should overtake only those who have fallen in the revolt.\"\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Last Words of Marcus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling together his friends and as many of his relations as were at hand, and setting his child before them, when all had come together, he raised himself gently on his pallet-bed, and began to speak as follows:\n\n\"That you should be grieved at seeing me in this state is not surprising, for it is natural to mankind to pity\n the misfortunes of their kinsfolk, and the calamities which fall under our own eyes call forth greater compassion. But I think that something even more will be forthcoming from you to me; for the consciousness of my feelings towards you has led me to hope for a recompense of goodwill from you. But now the time is well-timed both for me to learn that I have not lavished love and esteem upon you in vain for all these years, and for you by showing your gratitude to prove that you are not unmindful of the benefits you have received. You see here my son, whose bringing-up has been in your own hands, just embarking upon the age of manhood\n and, like a ship amid storm and breakers, in need of those who shall guide the helm, lest in his want of experience\n of the right course \n​\nhe should be dashed upon the rock of evil habits. Be ye therefore to him many fathers in the place of me, his one father, taking care of him and giving him the best counsel. For neither can any wealth, however abundant, suffice for the incontinence of a tyranny, nor a bodyguard be strong enough to protect the ruler, unless he has first of all the good-will of the governed. For those rulers complete a long course of sovranty without danger\n who instil into the hearts of their subjects not fear by their cruelty, but love by their goodness. For it is not those who serve as slaves under compulsion, but those who are obedient from persuasion, that are above suspicion, and continue doing and being done by without any cloak of flattery, and never show restiveness unless driven to it by violence and outrage. And it is difficult to check and put a just limit to our desires when Power is their minister. By giving my son then such advice, and bringing to his memory what he now hears with his own ears, you will render him both for yourselves and all mankind the best of kings, and you will do my memory the greatest of services,\n and thus alone be enabled to make it immortal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nSee above, i. 7; Fronto, \nDe Eloq.\n 3.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nSee above, i. 17, § 4.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nDio, 71. 35, §1.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nWho here uses as his authority \"The last great historian of Rome\"; see \nDas Kaiserhaus der Antonine und der Letzte Historiker Roms\n, Otto Th.

    "content": "Quick Summary:\n \nMeditations is a collection of personal writings by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, where he reflects on Stoic philosophy and offers guidance on how to live a virtuous life through self-discipline, rational thinking, and compassion.\n\n\nMeditations Book Summary\n\n\nMeditations was written by Marcus Aurelius, the last of the Five Good Emperors of Rome, during his reign from 161 to 180 AD. This book is not a traditional book but rather a series of notes and reflections that Marcus wrote for himself. He used these writings as a way to guide himself through the challenges of life and to reinforce his Stoic beliefs. Stoicism is a school of philosophy that teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means to overcome destructive emotions.\n\n\nThe book is divided into twelve books, each containing a collection of personal thoughts and philosophical ideas. Throughout his writings, Marcus emphasizes the importance of rationality, virtue, and understanding the nature of the universe. He urges the reader to focus on what they can control and to accept what they cannot control.\n\n\nAurelius’ Stoic philosophy teaches that individuals are responsible for their own thoughts and actions. He encourages readers to practice mindfulness, reflection, and self-discipline. The writings emphasize that humans are part of a larger whole and that recognizing this interconnectedness can lead to a more fulfilling life.\n\n\nKey themes in Meditations include the transient nature of life, the importance of virtue, and the need for emotional resilience. Marcus often reflects on the idea of mortality, reminding himself and the reader that life is short and should be lived meaningfully. He encourages individuals to act with integrity and to cultivate virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance.\n\n\nThroughout Meditations, Marcus also contemplates the value of inner peace and maintaining a calm mind amid life’s chaos. He believes that external circumstances should not disturb one’s inner tranquility. In many ways, Marcus’ reflections serve as a guide for dealing with adversity, personal challenges, and the unpredictability of life.\n\n\nIn summary, Meditations is a personal philosophical exploration that encourages readers to contemplate their lives, align their actions with their values, and strive for a sense of purpose. Marcus Aurelius’ thoughts continue to resonate with modern readers, providing timeless wisdom on living a good life.\n\n\nLessons From Meditations\n\n\nLesson 1: The Power of Perception\n\n\nOne of the essential lessons from Meditations is the power of perception. Marcus Aurelius emphasizes that our thoughts and perceptions shape our reality. He reminds us that while we cannot control external events, we can control how we respond to them. This idea is crucial in navigating our emotional responses and overall mindset. Changing the way we perceive challenges can help us transform obstacles into opportunities for growth.\n\n\nFor example, Marcus frequently writes about facing difficulties with courage and rationality. He believes that when faced with adversity, individuals should focus on maintaining a clear mind rather than succumbing to panic or despair. By viewing difficulties as chances to develop resilience, we can cultivate a more positive outlook.\n\n\nTo apply this lesson in daily life, one can practice mindfulness and self-reflection. Engaging in daily journaling or meditation can help clarify thoughts and perceptions, enabling us to respond to challenges more effectively. By consciously choosing to see events from a different angle, we can promote emotional well-being and personal growth.\n\n\nLesson 2: Embracing Impermanence\n\n\nAnother profound lesson in Meditations is the acceptance of impermanence. Marcus highlights that life is fleeting and that everything we know is temporary. Understanding this fundamental truth encourages individuals to appreciate the present moment and to prioritize what truly matters.\n\n\nMarcus frequently reflects on the idea that death is an inevitable part of life. By acknowledging our mortality, we can cultivate gratitude for each day and the relationships we have. He encourages us to seize the moment and not take life for granted.\n\n\nThis lesson teaches us to let go of attachments to material possessions or status and to focus on building meaningful connections with others. Embracing impermanence can also alleviate fear about the future. By fully engaging with the present and recognizing its value, we can create a more fulfilling life.\n\n\nLesson 3: The Importance of Virtue\n\n\nAt the heart of Marcus Aurelius’ writings lies the importance of virtue. His reflections consistently stress that living a virtuous life brings true happiness and fulfillment. Marcus believed that virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance are essential for achieving inner peace and satisfaction.\n\n\nThrough his writings, Marcus reveals that acting with integrity and practicing ethical behavior is vital, regardless of external circumstances. This commitment to virtue forms the foundation of character, guiding individuals in their decision-making processes and interactions with others.\n\n\nLiving in accordance with one’s values is fundamental in Stoic philosophy. Marcus encourages readers to make decisions rooted in virtue rather than being swayed by emotions or societal influences. By practicing virtue in daily life, individuals can navigate challenges with a clear moral compass and foster a sense of purpose.\n\n\nTo incorporate this lesson into our lives, we can identify our core values and strive to align our actions with them. Reflecting on our choices and examining whether they meet our standards for ethical behavior can help cultivate a virtuous mindset. This practice not only benefits ourselves but also positively impacts those around us.\n\n\nMeditations Book Review\n\n\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius is a powerful and thought-provoking work that transcends time.

For other uses, see \nMeditation (disambiguation)\n.\n\n\nMeditations \nEditio princeps\n by \nWilhelm Xylander\n in 1558\nAuthor\nMarcus Aurelius\nOriginal title\nUnknown, probably untitled\nLanguage\nKoine Greek\nPublication place\nRoman Empire\n\n\nMeditations\n (\nKoinē Greek\n: \nΤὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν\n, \nromanized: \nTa eis heauton\n, \nlit.\n \n''Things Unto Himself'') is a series of personal writings by \nMarcus Aurelius\n, \nRoman Emperor\n from 161–180 AD, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on \nStoic philosophy\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the \nMeditations\n in \nKoine Greek\n[\n1\n]\n as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement.\n[\n2\n]\n It is possible that large portions of the work were written at \nSirmium\n, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170–180 AD. A portion of his work was written while he was positioned at \nAquincum\n on campaign in \nPannonia\n, because internal notes reveal that the first book was written when he was campaigning against the \nQuadi\n on the river Granova (modern-day \nHron\n in \nSlovakia\n) and the second book was written at \nCarnuntum\n.\n\nIt is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published. The work has no official title, so \"Meditations\" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.\n\n\n\nStructure and themes\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nRuins of the ancient city of \nAquincum\n, in modern Hungary – one of the sites where Marcus Aurelius worked on \nMeditations\n.\n\n\nThe \nMeditations\n is divided into 12 books that chronicle different periods of Aurelius' life. The passages in each book are not necessarily in chronological order, seeing as they were written as Aurelius' own personal musings. The style of writing that permeates the text is one that is simplified, straightforward, and perhaps reflecting Aurelius' \nStoic\n perspective.\n\n\nA central theme to \nMeditations\n is the importance of analyzing one's judgment of self and others and developing a cosmic perspective:\n[\n3\n]\nYou have the power to strip away many superfluous troubles located wholly in your judgment, and to possess a large room for yourself embracing in thought the whole cosmos, to consider everlasting time, to think of the rapid change in the parts of each thing, of how short it is from birth until dissolution, and how the void before birth and that after dissolution are equally infinite. \nAurelius advocates finding one's place in the universe and sees that everything came from nature, and so everything shall return to it in due time. Another strong theme is of maintaining focus and to be without distraction all the while maintaining strong ethical principles such as \"Being a good man.\"\n[\n4\n]\n\n\nHis Stoic ideas often involve avoiding indulgence in sensory affections, a skill which will free a man from the pains and pleasures of the material world. He claims that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him. An internal orderly and rational nature, or \nlogos\n,\n permeates and guides all existence. \nRationality\n and \nclear-mindedness\n allow one to live in harmony with the \nlogos\n. This allows one to rise above faulty perceptions of \"good\" and \"bad\"—things out of your control like fame and wealth are (unlike things in your control) irrelevant and neither good nor bad.\n\n\n\nReception\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nAncient\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of \na series about\nMarcus Aurelius\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal\n\n\nEarly life\n\n\nMeditations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman emperor\n\n\nReign\n\n\nParthian War\n\n\nMarcomannic Wars\n\n\nAntonine Plague\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegacy\n\n\nTemple\n\n\nColumn\n\n\nEquestrian Statue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\nThe early history of the \nMeditations\n is unknown, and its earliest clear mention by another writer dates from the early 10th century.\n[\n5\n]\n The historian \nHerodian\n, writing in the mid-3rd century, makes mention of Marcus' literary legacy, saying \"He was concerned with all aspects of excellence, and in his love of ancient literature he was second to no man, Roman or Greek; this is evident from all his sayings and writings which have come down to us\", a passage which may refer to the \nMeditations\n. The \nHistoria Augusta\n'\ns biography of \nAvidius Cassius\n, thought to have been written in the 4th century, records that before Marcus set out on the \nMarcomannic Wars\n, he was asked to publish his \nPrecepts of Philosophy\n in case something should befall him, but he instead \"for three days discussed the books of his \nExhortations\n one after the other\".\n[\n6\n]\n A doubtful mention is made by the orator \nThemistius\n in about 364 C.E. In an address to the emperor \nValens\n, \nOn Brotherly Love\n, he says: \"You do not need the exhortations (\nGreek\n: \nπαραγγέλματα\n) of Marcus.\"\n[\n7\n]\n Another possible reference, in the \nGreek Anthology\n, is an epigram dedicated to \"the Book of Marcus,\" which has been attributed to the 7th century \nByzantine\n scholar \nTheophylact Simocatta\n.\n[\n8\n]\n\n\n\n\nMedieval\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe first direct mention of the work comes from \nArethas of Caesarea\n (c. 860–935), a bishop who was a great collector of manuscripts.\n[\n9\n]\n At some date before 907 he sent a volume of the \nMeditations\n to Demetrius, \nArchbishop of Heracleia\n [\nit\n]\n, with a letter saying: \"I have had for some time an old copy of the Emperor Marcus' most profitable book, so old indeed that it is altogether falling to pieces.… This I have had copied and am able to hand down to posterity in its new dress.\"\n[\n10\n]\n Arethas also mentions the work in marginal notes (\nscholia\n) to books by \nLucian\n and \nDio Chrysostom\n where he refers to passages in the \"Treatise to Himself\" (\nGreek\n: \nτὰ εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἠθικά\n), and it was this title which the book bore in the manuscript from which the first printed edition was made in the 16th century.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\n Arethas' own copy has now vanished, but it is thought to be the likely ancestor of the surviving manuscripts.\n[\n10\n]\n The next mention of the \nMeditations\n is in the \nSuda\n lexicon published in the late 10th century.\n[\n11\n]\n The \nSuda\n calls the work \"a directing (\nGreek\n: \nἀγωγή\n) of his own life by Marcus the Emperor in twelve books,\"\n[\n12\n]\n which is the first mention of a division of the work into twelve books.\n[\n11\n]\n The \nSuda\n makes use of some thirty quotations taken from books I, III, IV, V, IX, and XI.\n[\n12\n]\n Around 1150, \nJohn Tzetzes\n, a grammarian of Constantinople, quotes passages from Books IV and V attributing them to Marcus.\n[\n12\n]\n About 200 years later \nNicephorus Callistus\n (c. 1295–1360) in his \nEcclesiastical History\n writes that \"Marcus Antoninus composed a book for the education of his son Marcus [i.e. \nCommodus\n], full of all worldly (\nGreek\n: \nκοσμικῆς\n) experience and instruction.\"\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\n The \nMeditations\n is thereafter quoted in many Greek compilations from the 14th to 16th centuries.\n[\n13\n]\n This, specifically after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, as it was among the Greek texts reintroduced by fleeing scholars to European intellectual circles.\n[\n14\n]\n\n\nThe present-day text is based almost entirely upon two manuscripts. One is the \nCodex Palatinus\n (P), also known as the \nCodex Toxitanus\n (T), that was first published in 1558–59 but is now lost.\n[\n15\n]\n The other manuscript is the \nCodex Vaticanus 1950\n (A) in the \nVatican Library\n,\n[\n15\n]\n which passed there from the collection of \nStefano Gradi\n in 1683,\n[\n16\n]\n is a 14th-century manuscript which survives in a very corrupt state, and about forty-two lines have dropped out by accidental omissions.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n17\n]\n Other manuscripts are of little independent value for reconstructing the text.\n[\n18\n]\n The main ones are the \nCodex Darmstadtinus 2773\n (D) with 112 extracts from books I–IX, and the \nCodex Parisinus 319\n (C) with 29 extracts from Books I–IV.\n[\n15\n]\n\n\n\n\nModern\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\n\"Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered\"\n\n\nThe modern history of the \nMeditations\n dates from the issue of the first printed edition (\neditio princeps\n) by \nWilhelm Xylander\n in 1558 or 1559.\n[\n19\n]\n It was published at the instigation of \nConrad Gesner\n and printed by his cousin Andreas Gesner at \nZürich\n.\n[\n19\n]\n The book was bound with a work by \nMarinus\n (\nProclus vel De Felicitate\n, also a first edition).\n[\n19\n]\n To the \nMeditations\n was added a Latin translation by Xylander who also included brief notes.\n[\n19\n]\n Conrad Gesner stated in his dedicatory letter that he \"received the books of Marcus from the gifted poet \nMichael Toxites\n from the library of \nOtto Heinrich, Prince Palatine\n\", i.e. from the collection at \nHeidelberg University\n.\n[\n19\n]\n The importance of this edition of the \nMeditations\n is that the manuscript from which it was printed is now lost, so that it is one of the two principal sources of all modern texts.\n[\n19\n]\n\n\nGilbert Murray\n compares the work to \nJean-Jacques Rousseau's\n \nConfessions\n and \nSt. Augustine's\n \nConfessions\n.\n[\n20\n]\n In the Introduction to his 1964 translation of \nMeditations\n, the Anglican priest \nMaxwell Staniforth\n discussed the profound impact of \nStoicism\n on \nChristianity\n.\n[\n21\n]\n Rees (1992) calls the \nMeditations\n \"unendingly moving and inspiring,\" but does not offer them up as works of original philosophy, though he does find an element of Marcus' Stoic philosophy in the philosophical system of \nImmanuel Kant\n.\n[\n22\n]\n\n\nWen Jiabao\n, the former Prime Minister of China, has said that he has read the \nMeditations\n a hundred times. He also stated that he was \"very deeply impressed\" by the work.\n[\n23\n]\n It has been described as \"a favorite\" of former United States President \nBill Clinton\n.\n[\n24\n]\n\n\n\n\nEditions\n[\nedit\n]\n\n\nThe \neditio princeps\n (first print edition) of the original Greek was published by \nConrad Gessner\n and his cousin Andreas in 1559. Both it and the accompanying Latin translation were produced by \nWilhelm Xylander\n. His source was a manuscript from \nHeidelberg University\n, provided by \nMichael Toxites\n. By 1568, when Xylander completed his second edition, he no longer had access to the source and it has been lost ever since.\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\n The first English translation was published in 1634 by \nMeric Casaubon\n.\n\nSome popular English translations include:\n\n\n\nFrancis Hutcheson\n, and James Moore (1742). \nThe Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus\n.

Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in Koine Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the first book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the second book was written at Carnuntum. It is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published and the work has no official title, so \"Meditations\" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.\nGenres\nPhilosophy\nNonfiction\nClassics\nHistory\nSelf Help\nPsychology\nPersonal Development\n \n...more\n270 pages, Paperback\nFirst published January 1, 180\n \nBook details & editions\n99.7k people are currently reading\n543k people want to read\nAbout the author\nMarcus Aurelius\n1,147\n \nbooks\n5,988\n \nfollowers\nFollow\nFollow\nMarcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus\n (often referred to as \"the wise\") was Emperor of the Roman Empire from 161 to his death in 180. He was the last of the \"Five Good Emperors\", and is also considered one of the more important Stoic philosophers. His two decades as emperor were marked by near continual warfare. He was faced with a series of invasions from German tribes, and by conflicts with the Parthian Empire in the east. His reign also had to deal with an internal revolt in the east, led by Avidius Cassius.\nMarcus Aurelius' work \nMeditations\n, written in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180, is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty and has been praised for its \"exquisite accent and its infinite tenderness.\"\nRatings \n&\n Reviews\nWhat do \nyou\n think?\nRate this book\nWrite a Review\nFriends \n&\n Following\n \nCreate a free account\n \nto discover what your friends think of this book!\nCommunity Reviews\n4.28\n309,950\n \nratings\n17,789\n \nreviews\n5 stars\n162,339 (52%)\n4 stars\n91,870 (29%)\n3 stars\n41,111 (13%)\n2 stars\n10,225 (3%)\n1 star\n4,405 (1%)\nSearch review text\nFilters\nDisplaying 1 - 30 of 17,780 reviews\nGlenn Russell\n1,485 reviews\n12.9k followers\nFollow\nFollow\nAugust 2, 2021\nIn many important ways, the reflections of Marcus Aurelius (121 AD-180 AD) crystallize the philosophical wisdom of the Greco-Roman world. This little book was written as a diary to himself while emperor fighting a war out on the boarder of the Roman Empire and today this book is known to us as \nThe Meditations\n.\nThe Roman philosophers are not as well known or as highly regarded as Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, or Zeno the Stoic - and for a simple reason: the Roman thinkers were not primarily interested in abstract theory; rather, they were concerned with behavior, that is, understanding how to live in the everyday world and putting their understanding into practice,the goal being to live the life of an authentic philosopher, to be a person of high character and integrity and virtue, to develop inner strength and a quiet mind and value such strength and quietude above all else. \nIndeed, to accomplish such a lofty goal, the Romans realized the need for radical transformation, a complete overhauling of one's life through rigorous mental and physical training, like turning base metal into pure gold. And once a person takes on the role of a philosopher, their deeds must reflect their words - no hypocrisy, thank you! Thus, it isn't surprising the Romans put a premium on memorizing and internalizing simple proverbs and maxims and employed the metaphor of philosophy as the medicine to cure a sick soul.\nTurning now to Marcus Aurelius, we can appreciate how he imbibed the wisdom not only from the Stoics (along with Seneca and Epictetus, Marcus is considered one of the three major Roman Stoics), but he was also willing to learn from the schools of Epicurus, Plato and Aristotle. In the Greco-Roman world, being eclectic was perfectly acceptable; truth was valued over who said what.\nWe find several recurring themes in \nThe Meditations\n: \n1) develop self-discipline to gain control over judgments and desires; \n2) overcoming a fear of death;\n3) value an ability to retreat into a rich, interior mental life (one's inner citadel); \n4) recognize the world as a manifestation of the divine; \n5) live according to reason; \n6) avoid luxury and opulence. \nBut generalizations will not approach the richness and wisdom nuggets a reader will find in Marcus's actual words. Thus I'll conclude with my personal observations coupled with quotes from Book One, wherein Marcus begins by expressing heartfelt thanks to his family and teachers for the many fine lessons he learned as a youth. Here are four of my favorites:\n\"Not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home\" ---------- After my own nasty experience with the mindless competition and regimentation of public schools, I wish I had Marcus's good fortune of excellent home schooling.\n\"Not to meddle with other people's affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.\" ---------- I didn't need a teacher here; I recognized on my own at an early age that gossip is a colossal waste of time and energy, both listening to gossip and spreading gossip. I can't imagine a clearer indication of a base, coarse mind than someone inclined to gossip and slandering others.\n\"To read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book.\" ---------- How true. Reading isn't a race to get to the last page; matter of fact, I agree with Jorge Luis Borges that focused, precise rereading is the key to opening oneself to the wisdom of a book.\n\"To be satisfied on all occasions, and be cheerful.\" ---------- I'm never in a hurry. Life is too beautiful to be in a hurry. For me, there is only one way to live each day: in joy and free from anxiety and worry. In a sense, along with the goal of virtue, all of the meditations of Marcus Aurelius amplify this simple view of life.\nI've written this review as an encouragement to make Marcus Aurelius a part of your life. You might not agree with everything he has to say, but you have to admit, Marcus has a really cool beard and head of hair.\nBrad Lyerla\n214 reviews\n221 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nAugust 12, 2024\nWhen I was a freshman in college, I lived in a dorm. My roommate was on the football team. He would write inspiring things on poster board and hang them in our room often on the ceiling above his bed to motivate himself. He favored straightforward sentiments like \"never give up.\"\nThe Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius did not hang motivational posters for inspiration. Instead, he kept a journal in which he collected his thoughts about how to live well. MEDITATIONS is that book. \nMost people have heard that Aurelius counsels to expect the worst and you will never be disappointed. While that is part of what he has to say, it is not the most interesting of what he has to say. At his most thoughtful, Aurelius calls on us to ask the best of ourselves and never mind the behavior of others. His MEDITATIONS is a work of motivational advice to inspire us in the ways of stoicism. It is a manual for being a complete, mature adult. It is a guide for living a dignified, thoughtful life. \nConsider: \"Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow 'or the day after'. Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn't kick up a fuss about which day it was - what difference could it make? Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small.\" Book IV (Greg Hays trans., Modern Library)\nOr: \"Concentrate every minute like a Roman - like a man - on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from distractions. Yes, you can - if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that's all even the gods can ask of you.\" Book II\nAnd: \"If at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, honesty, self-control, courage - than a mind satisfied that it succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and satisfied to accept what is beyond its control - if you find anything better than that, embrace it without reservations - it must be an extraordinary thing indeed - and enjoy it to the full.\" Book III\nThat these thoughts came from the most powerful man in the world, a man whose personal power so vastly exceeded the personal power of any American president that we have difficulty comprehending it, makes it all the more impressive. Aurelius continually writes that strength comes from humility, self-restraint and good humor towards others. He teaches us to accept what we cannot control and to trust what we know.\nGood advice, indeed.\nfavorites\nAlexandra Petri\nAuthor \n8 books\n405 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nDecember 30, 2014\nThis basically consists of Marcus Aurelius repeating, \"Get it together, Marcus\" to himself over and over again over the course of 12 chapters. \nSPOILER ALERT:\n-The time during which you are alive is very very brief compared to the time during which you did not exist and will not exist. \n-People who wrong you only do so from ignorance, and if you can correct them without being a jerk about it, you should do so.\n-You are a little soul dragging around a corpse. \n-Whether or not things injure you lies in your opinion about them, and you can control that opinion. \nThat's about it. \nThe fascinating thing about these philosophical ideas is that if they were expressed a single time, they might seem profound and solid and convincing. But repeated over and over like a rosary, you feel that Marcus is struggling against really serious grueling daily doubt -- that these are things that he wishes to be true, not things that he knows to be true, normative rather than descriptive statements. Which makes for a fascinating and subtext-y read, especially given his history. \nSean Barrs \n1,122 reviews\n47.4k followers\nFollow\nFollow\nSeptember 27, 2020\n\n\n\n\nLook within: do not allow the special quality or worth of anything to pass you by.\n\n\n\n\nI love this quote and I love the wisdom that runs through this book. It’s such a simple idea and it is also a very true one. Make the most of everything and everyone, of every situation and chance that life throws your way because when they have passed, we may not get them again.\n \nMarcus Aurelius is full of logic and revealing comments about life, death and the universe. His meditations are very open and very honest. And I found them quite touching. The history of his reign as Roman Emperor is impressive, but behind all his success was a very human person struggling and suffering with the same problems that plague all of us. He comes to terms with his mortality and his insignificance in the face of history and time. We are all of us only here a brief time, and we need to make the most of it. \n\n\nAll is ephemeral, both memory and the object of memory\n\n\nThe book moves into discussions over the temporary nature of things, of relationships and friendships and feelings. Everything changes given enough time, even memories and their ramifications. Aurelius soul searches. He writes these words during times of peace and war, during times of duty and heart ache, though his tone rarely changes. He remains detached and accepting of destiny and where it may take him. From this he ponders how to give life meaning and purpose.\nAurelius suggests that one of the ways we can do this is through work, real work and toil as we strive to meet our goals. He suggests that it is an edifying pursuit, to serve the development of humanity. It gives life meaning and purpose as we work and improve. He also argues for the creation of art and that in attaining it, it's one of the greatest pursuits we can follow because of how it benefits mankind. I agree with so many of the sentiments in here, and those that challenged my own beliefs got me thinking about the nature of life.\n5-star-reads\n \nancient-rome\n \nphilosophy\nMaru Kun\n221 reviews\n551 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nMay 11, 2015\nMarcus gives us wise advice about using the Internet, particularly social networking sites:\n“...because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, is this necessary…”\nHe shares his opinions on the worst types of modern professional. He does not approve of lobbyists and is rightly worried about their influence on the legislative process. We should heed his words:\n“...so long as the law is safe, so is the city and the citizen…”.\nHe has harsh things to say about public relations executives;\n“...to say what you don't think - the definition of absurdity…”.\nHe understands the modern office dynamic, reminding himself:\n“...Not to be constantly telling people that I am too busy, unless I really am. Similarly, not to be always ducking my responsibilities to the people around me because of \"pressing business\"...\"\nMarcus has advice for politicians, which it is clear from this book he thinks are untrustworthy, illogical and prone to anger. He condemns unreservedly all their faults and the problems with the modern electoral system:\n“...it makes you betray a trust, or lose your sense of shame, or make you show hatred, suspicion, ill will, or hypocrisy, or a desire for things best done behind closed doors. \n“...A desire for things best done behind closed doors…”\n - Marcus is spot on in identifying a lack of democratic accountability, fostered by the CIA, NSA, GCHQ and the rest of the security paraphernalia, as being at the root of many of our current political problems.\nIn the UK there is a tradition for politicians, or at least for the posher type of politician, to study “PPE” or “Politics, Philosophy and Economics” at either Oxford or Cambridge University. \nBut despite such an expensive education our political masters don't have half the grasp on the classics that Marcus has, which is remarkable considering he was home-schooled. I wish Marcus would consider a career in politics just to show up our current representatives for the intellectual pygmies that they really are. \nMarcus also gives us advice on a more personal level. I don’t know much about his background but I can be sure he is the father of teenage children! Can he really keep his temper?\n“...they are drawn toward what they think is good for them, but if it is not good for them then prove it to them instead of losing your temper…”\nUnlike other self-help writers he doesn’t flinch at reminding us about our own mortality:\n“...Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly…” \nWe should remember:\n“...not to live as if you had endless years in front of you. Death overshadows you. While you're alive and able, be good…”\nand also\n“...how much more damage anger and grief do than the things that cause them…”\nHow refreshing if more authors of self help books would confront squarely the central issue of our own mortality and our negative emotions of anger or frustration instead of forever hiding from these topics.\nSo to end with my favorite paragraph, from book 10 paragraph 5. One for physicists as well as philosophers to puzzle over:\n“...whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together: your own existence and the things that happen to you. ..”\nI don’t normally read self help books. Often they seem full of cliches left over from the Victorian era. And in this book, which may have been modeled on the writings of Alain De Botton, Marcus mixes in a lot of philosophy and this just isn’t to everyone’s taste.\nBut with this short work Marcus, who is Italian, and his co-author Gregory Hays have brought the format right up to date by reflecting squarely on the types of issues that we all face today.\nA great book by an author who - and this is no exaggeration - deserves a statue to be put up for him. I can only wish I could meet Marcus one day. In fact I’ll be checking out if he has any book signings lined up. If he has a decent agent I’m sure he has.\nbooks-dave-might-like\n \nphilosophy\n \nreview-or-reviewed\n \n...more\nValeriu Gherghel\nAuthor \n6 books\n1,959 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nJuly 2, 2024\n„Lasă deoparte cărţile! Nu te mai chinui...” (II: 2)\n„Înlătură setea de cărţi, ca să nu mori cîrtind, ci cu adevărat senin şi recunoscător din toată inima zeilor” (II: 3).\nCînd Marcus Aurelius notează acest îndemn ciudat (cel puțin pentru cititorul de astăzi), el se gîndește, de fapt, la un singur om: la el însuși. Împăratul nu a intenționat niciodată să scrie o carte propriu-zisă și pentru un public larg, precum Seneca, precum prietenul Fronto. Și cu atît mai puțin să o publice.\nÎnsemnările lui au avut din capul locului un singur destinatar. Și acest destinatar nu a fost altul decît Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus (121 - 180). N-a voit să fie învățătorul altcuiva. N-a sfătuit pe nimeni. Nu a impus altora cum să-și trăiască viața. A scris pentru sine, așa cum arată titlul meditațiilor sale: \nTa eis heauton [hypomnemata]: Gînduri către sine însuși\n. Deși titlul nu-i aparține.\nScria noaptea, în puținul timp rămas liber, pe cîmpul de luptă, în cortul de ostaș, luminat precar, în lungile și obositoarele campanii purtate la granițele imperiului, prin „țara cvazilor, pe malul rîului Granua” (adică în Panonia de azi), cum precizează într-un rînd (I: 17), prin ținuturile triburilor germane, în Galia ori în Asia Mică. Nu a avut deloc vanitate de autor. Vreme de mai bine de un mileniu, lucrarea lui a fost foarte puțin cunoscută. O menționează doar Arethas din Caesarea în secolul X.\nObservațiile împăratului, scrise în limba greacă (și nu în latină), între anii 170 și 180, au fost tipărite abia în 1558, după un manuscris azi pierdut.\nPrin urmare, îndemnul „Înlătură setea de cărți, ca să nu mori cîrtind!” este adresat numai și numai sieși. El poate fi interpretat, desigur, în multe feluri.\nAr fi, mă gîndesc, strigătul de exasperare al unui cititor pragmatic, care înțelege dintr-o dată puținul folos adus de cărți. Ar reprezenta astfel un reproș adus omului care citește în loc să ia parte la viața publică. Reproșul este perfect stoic. Seninătatea, apatheia nu se obțin prin răsfoirea cărților, ci prin exercițiu spiritual, prin meditație asiduă la destin, natură și moarte. În concluzie, convingerea lui Marcus Aurelius pare să fi fost aceasta: cînd te confrunți cu bătrînețea, cu fragilitatea ființei umane, cu moartea, cărțile (și lectura) sînt de puțin folos. Seneca a afirmat același lucru: e mult mai util să meditezi la un scurt pasaj decît să răsfoiești zilnic mormane de cărți. Ca filosof din stirpea stoicilor, împăratul Marcus Aurelius nu a iubit prea mult cărțile, dar nu cred că a fost un bibliofob veritabil...\nAdaug un singur citat despre nimicnicia tuturor lucrurilor pe care le prețuim fără temei: \n„După cum ne formăm reprezentări despre felurile de mîncare, gîndind că acesta este cadavrul unui peşte, acesta – al unei păsări sau al unui porc, şi, de asemenea, că vinul de Falern este sucul stors din struguri şi că toga pretextă e lînă de oaie impregnată cu sînge de scoică…, tot aşa trebuie să procedăm toată viaţa şi, cînd ne reprezentăm lucrurile ca prea demne de încredere, trebuie să le dezgolim, să le surprindem mica lor valoare şi să înlăturăm pretinsa credibilitate datorită căreia erau considerate de valoare. Periculoasă amăgire este trufia şi, cînd socoteşti mai degrabă că te ocupi de lucruri importante, atunci mai ales eşti victima iluziei” (VI: 13).\nP. S.\n De la stoici, probabil, a învățat E. M. Cioran lecția deprecierii lucrurilor sfinte: „Sărutul nu e decît amestecul a două salive”.\nAlways Pouting\n576 reviews\n973 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nFebruary 14, 2020\nSomeone lent me this because they thought it might help me feel better/change my thinking. I was like sure I'll give it a chance but like sorry to say it did nothing. I feel as though many of the things in there that might be helpful are things I've already gotten elsewhere by this point or attitudes I already hold. Also I'm not sure but was this written at the end of his life because he just seems like he's mostly grappling with his impending mortality and what it means to be alive and how one can live in the right way. I personally couldn't care less about being dead so I'm not sure that's something I found resonated with me, it might for others though. Also just a lot of determinism and mind/body duality in there neither of which I personally believe to be true so that didn't endear me to it. What I'm trying to say is I can see why this might help other people in their own thinking/learning to cope with being alive but it just didn't do it for me.

What could suit you more than that?” \n“Even if you were destined to live three thousand years, or ten times that long, nevertheless remember that no one loses any life other than the one he lives, or lives any life other than the one he loses…No one can lose either the past or the future – how could anyone be deprived of what he does not possess?…It is only the present moment of which either stands to be deprived: and if indeed this is all he has, he cannot lose what he does not have.” \n“Men seek retreats for themselves – in the country, by the sea, in the hills – and you yourself are particularly prone to this yearning. But all this is quite unphilosophic, when it is open to you, at any time you want, to retreat into yourself. No retreat offers someone more quiet and relaxation then that into his own mind, especially if he can dip into thoughts there which put him at immediate and complete ease: and by ease I simply mean a well ordered life.” \n“So discard all else and secure these few things only. Remind yourself too that each of us lives only in the present moment, a mere fragment of time: the rest is life past or uncertain future. Sure, life is a small thing, and small the cranny of the earth in which we live it: small too even the longest fame thereafter, which is itself subject to a succession of a little men who will quickly die, and have no knowledge even of themselves, let alone of those long dead.” \n“What a tiny part of the boundless abyss of time has been allotted to each of us – and this is soon vanished in eternity; what a tiny part of the universal substance and the universal soul; how tiny in the whole earth the mere clod on which you creep.

The style of writing that permeates the text is one that is simplified, straightforward, and perhaps reflecting Aurelius' Stoic perspective on the text.Aurelius advocates finding one's place in the universe and sees that everything came from nature, and so everything shall return to it in due time. \nAnother strong theme is of maintaining focus and to be without distraction all the while maintaining strong ethical principles such as \n\"Being a good man.\"\nتاریخ نخستین خوانش روز نوزدهم ماه سپتامبر سال2006میلادی\nعنوان: ت‍ام‍لات‌؛ نویسنده: م‍ارک‍وس‌ اورل‍ی‍وس‌ امپراتور روم؛ مت‍رج‍م ع‍رف‍ان‌ ث‍اب‍ت‍ی‌؛ تهران، ققنوس، سال1384؛ در158ص؛ شابک9643116107؛ چاپ دوم سال1387؛ شابک9789643116101؛ چاپ سوم سال1389؛ چاپ چهارم سال1391؛ چاپ پنجم سال1393؛ چاپ هفتم سال1396؛ چاپ هشتم سال1397؛ ویراست دوم تهران، ققنوس، چاپهای دهم و یازدهم سال1398؛ در192ص؛ شابک9786220402916؛ موضوع راه و رسم زندگی از نویسندگان روم باستان - سده02میلادی\nعنوان: ت‍ام‍لات‌؛ نویسنده: م‍ارک‍وس‌ اورل‍ی‍وس‌ امپراتور روم؛ مت‍رج‍مها: م‍ه‍دی‌ ب‍اق‍ی‌، ش‍ی‍ری‍ن‌ م‍خ‍ت‍اری‍ان‌؛ تهران، نشر نی، سال1384؛ در159ص؛ شابک9643127931؛ چاپ دوم سال1386؛ شابک9789643127930؛ \nعنوان: تاملات؛ مارکوس ارلیوس (اورلیوس)؛ مترجم بابک کیان؛ تهران، میلکان، سال1398؛ در184ص؛ شابک ندارد\nاین کتاب با بازنویسی «دونالد راتسون» و با عنوان «چگونه مانند یک امپراتور بیندیشیم» نیز چاپ شده است\nمارکوس آئورلیوس آنتونیوس، یا «مارک اورل»، از امپراتوران بزرگ «روم» بوده اند؛ ایشان یکی از «پنج امپراتور خوب»، از دودمان «آنتونی نروایی»، و یک فیلسوف رواقی (براساس آموزه های این فلسفه انسان باید راه رسیدن به خوشبختی را پیدا کند) بودند؛ که در روز بیست و ششم از ماه آوریل سال121میلادی زاده‌ شدند، و در روز هفدم از ماه مارس سال180میلادی به بیماری تیفوس درگذشتند؛ ایشان نقش برجسته‌ ای در آخرین دوره ی جنگ‌های «رم» علیه «اشکانیان» داشتند، این کتاب را بین سال‌های170میلادی تا سال180میلادی، در حالی که «روم» در جنگ بود، بنگاشتند؛ «مارکوس آئورلیوس» فرمانروایی بودند، که فرمانروایی را دوست نداشتند؛ ایشان از کودکی میخواستند فیلسوف شوند، او با خوانش زندگی «سقراط» به وجد می‌آمد، کتاب «تأملات» اثری شامل دوازده کتاب است؛ که «آئورلیوس» اندیشه‌های خود را در آنها بیان کرده‌ اند؛ این اثر که شامل متن‌های کوتاه و یادداشت‌هاست؛ در دنیای غرب بسیار مورد توجه است، و بارها به زبان‌های اروپایی ترجمه شده‌ است\nنقل از متن: (مرا بردار و هر جای این جهان که می‌خواهی بینداز! هر جا که باشم، خدای قلبم را خوشحال و راضی نگاه می‌دارد؛ که این نتیجه وقتی‌ست که کردار و رفتار ما، طبیعت حقیقی خود را دنبال کنند…؛ آیا آنچه که بر من می‌گذرد دلیلی کافی خواهد بود برای اینکه من بیمار و شکسته، تحقیر شده و گرسنه، و در غل و زنجیر باشم؟ آیا -هیچ جا- دلیلی کافی برای این‌گونه زیستن داری؟؛\nای هستی! نظم تو نظم درونی من است: هیچ چیز اگر در زمان مناسب توست، نه بر من زود و نه بر من دیر است؛ ای حقیقت هستی! هرچه که فصل‌هایت بار آرد بر من میوه (رضا) است: که همه چیز از تو می‌آید و هستی همه چیز در توست و به تو بازمی‌گردد…؛\nاین فکر را که «من رنج کشیده‌ام» را بیرون کن و رنج، خود بیرون خواهد رفت\nشرم‌آور است که عقل، ظاهرمان را شکل می‌دهد، اما قادر به شکل‌دادن خود نیست؛ بدیهی است که هیچ‌گاه در زندگی شرایطی بهتر از این برای فراگیری فلسفه نخواهی داشت!؛\nزمانی که روز خود را آغاز می‌کنید، به این فکر کنید که چه موهبت با ارزشیست که زنده اید - که نفس می‌کشید، تفکر می‌کنید، لذت می‌برید، که عشق می‌ورزید\nشادی زندگی شما به کیفیت افکارتان بستگی دارد\nبه درونت بنگر! در درونت چشمه ی قدرتی وجود دارد که هر وقت بخوانی اش، به تو یاری خواهد کرد\nخودت را در رویاهای داشتن چیزهایی که نداری، غرق نکن، اما موهبت‌هایی که دارا هستی را بشمار، و شکرگزارانه به خاطر داشته باش که چطور رؤیای داشتنشان را در سرت می‌پروراندی اگر نداشتی‌شان\nهدف زندگی این نیست که با اکثریت همراه شوی، بلکه در نپیوستن به جمع بیخردان است\nاصلی که بایستی در آینده به خاطر بسپاری، وقتی که رنج‌ها مجبورت می‌کنند که احساس تلخی کنی، این است: که افتادن اتفاق تلخ بداقبالی نیست، که تحمل رنج‌ها بدون از دست دادن امید است، که خوش‌ اقبالی است)؛ پایان\nتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 01/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی\nAdam Dalva\nAuthor \n8 books\n2,037 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nJune 19, 2020\nIt's, of course, completely ridiculous to rate a nearly 2000 year old journal by a Roman emperor who never intended it to be read.

When they're good, they're incredible:\n\"At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: 'I have to go to work - as a human being.

Observațiile împăratului, scrise în limba greacă (și nu în latină), așa era moda printre nobili (Atena cucerise deja Roma), între anii 170 și 180, au fost tipărite abia în 1558, după un manuscris azi pierdut. Împăratul consemna sugestii, vorbea cu sine, reflecta, veghea. Nu a avut deloc vanitate de autor. \nAș menționa că Marcus Aurelius a scris mereu și mereu pentru un singur destinatar: pentru sine, așa cum arată însuși titlul meditațiilor sale: \nTa eis heauton\n, \nCătre mine însumi\n. Nu se gîndea la un cititor străin, la viitor și postumitate, caietul lui de însemnări îl însoțea pretutindeni, în tabere îndeosebi, prin „țara quazilor, aproape de rîul Granua” (adică în Panonia de azi), cum precizează într-un fragment (II: incipit, p.83), prin ținuturile triburilor germane, în Galia ori în Asia Mică. Împăratul controla riguros legiunile, taberele, castrele de pe granița imperiului, doar noaptea avea timp să noteze, într-un cort de soldat, la lumina precară a unui \nlucubrum\n, în puținul timp liber. \nMarcus Aurelius a fost un gînditor stoic dublat de un cinic. Prefera franchețea cea mai brutală. Într-o notă, afirmă netulburat: „Iubirea se reduce la frecarea a două epiderme, la un spasm, la o secreție vîscoasă” (VI: 13, p.177). \nÎn altă parte, împăratul scrie: „Înlătură setea de cărți, ca să nu mori cîrtind, ci dimpotrivă, cu adevărat mulţumit, senin şi recunoscător din toată inima zeilor!” (II: 3, p.85). Adaugă imediat: „Lasă deoparte cărţile! Nu te mai chinui! Nu îţi este dat...”. Nimic mai enigmatic decît aceste enunțuri lapidare. Moartea se cuvine întîmpinată în liniște. \nÎn opinia filosofului, am impresia, cărțile reprezintă doar un prilej de a murmura împotriva autorilor și a gîndurilor exprimate de ei, împotriva morții binefăcătoare. Este preferabil, în consecință, să primești sfîrșitul cu deplină smerenie, cu sufletul împăcat. Cărțile nu dau un exemplu bun. În tragediile grecești, în \nAntigona\n, să zicem, nu găsim decît lamentații, împotrivire, lipsă de măsură, o frenezie zadarnică. \nÎn concluzie, renunță la cărți, scapă de acest neajuns! În pofida prestigiosului îndemn, nu voi renunța să recitesc meditațiile celui mai onest dintre împărații romani.\nP. S.\n În istoria sa, Edward Gibbon ironizează naivitatea lui Marcus Aurelius. Chiar la începutul însemnărilor, împăratul mulțumește zeilor că a avut parte de „o soţie [Annia Galeria Faustina] atît de ascultătoare, de afectuoasă, de simplă” (I: 17, p.81).

He sure was a prolific note-taker, for these meditations are surely his study-notes(?- after all he was a 'philosopher' from age 12). I don't know of the publishing system at the time but where are the detailed footnotes and references? Marcus Aurelius is quite a wise man or at least he read enough wise men. He sure nailed it as far as boring a reader is concerned. No better way to establish your book's wisdom quotient.\nI am being needlessly caustic of course(do note my rating above). The book is quotable in almost every page and is good to dip in to now and then, you might well find an aphorism that fits the mood just right every time.

You can imagine the difficulties which transpired, people accepted pain and suffering without complaint, the land of the strong endured disasters and continued. The unnatural way is quite strange as people want to breathe fire in hell, not be lambs heading to the slaughterhouse without putting on a good fight against such a notion, history has shown this propensity. The good Emperor to show the Romans how to serve the world, not rule for selfish reasons was the only proper thing though the concept would be almost impossible to realize then and for modern people failure to engulf this a puzzlement, quite understandable still, for nature is painful. . Yet few believed, greed and ambition the ultimate climb to raw power has a magical temptation not able to be tamed by an old philosophy thousands of years old which the people today will neglect, truth like a sinking useless ship which is empty of valuables slowly turns over and falls to the sparse bottom never to arise again...No one cares the ultimate knowledge each will try to discover for themselves by opening a door, the truth may be inside the hall or not , set you free, or bring destruction, maybe a clue to what you seek....however only time the judge of wisdom prevails .

His work, however, has become one of the most important texts representing Stoic philosophy. The ancient book is divided into twelve chapters. They embark on exploring such eternal themes as life and death, aspirations and fears, a place of an individual in society, personal priorities, and ways of achieving peace of mind. As to the last point, the crowned philosopher gives some practical recommendations that could be incorporated into our modern lives.\nFor example, Marcus Aurelius suggests that we concentrate on our inner lives while being open and well-disposed to the world. One should respect those who surround them but not connect their self-esteem and mental health with what others say.\nIt seems very relevant today when most of us are connected with so many different people via social media. Becoming dependent on the number of likes on our posts is relatively easy, is it not? However, we had better avoid this and should never measure our success only by such external factors.\nIt never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.\nMeditations\n deal extensively with the concept of death. Marcus Aurelius explains why one must not be afraid of inevitable demise. \nEverything in this world is transient. All our accomplishments will sooner or later fade into oblivion. Our difficulties, no matter how cruel they seem to us, are not original. People in the past have already gone through similar ordeals, and the future will bring the same problems. \nAll the great people of the past (caesars, writers, sculptors) perished, as did ordinary people. The end is the same for everyone. Therefore, in a wider sense, it does not matter whether or not you have lived a long and prosperous life. I think the author expands on this topic because he wants to provide himself or his invisible reader with some sort of consolation. Life is not always fair. Sh*t happens even to virtuous people. We must accept things that we are not able to change and improve those that can be rectified. Whatever happens, we can choose how to respond to it. These reflections represent one of the tenets of Stoicism.\nThe man in charge of the great empire does not attach weight to the posthumous fame or slander that may haunt famous people both during their lifetime and after. Praise and calumny are equally considered vanities. \nInstead, the author believes in public duty and the necessity of doing the right things and being decent under any circumstances. One should do what he or she thinks right to do without expecting gratitude in response. Kindness to others and worthy deeds give a sense of fulfillment, which means that they are more than enough to make us happy. He also warns against being judgmental toward others. How can we judge others if we are not perfect ourselves? \nAll these and many other ideas are discussed in the book in a much more subtle way. I have just tried to translate them into the modern language. \nThe key ideas get repetitive throughout the book. Some would probably prefer to read it with breaks. You can start reading it from any chapter. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it almost in a single sitting. The writing style is accessible. The book makes us reflect on ourselves and the world around us.\nIn conclusion, I will let the author speak for himself so you may judge for yourself.\n\"The perfection of moral character consists in this, in passing every day as the last, and in being neither violently excited nor torpid nor playing the hypocrite.\"\n“Confine yourself to the present.”\n\"Consider that as the heaps of sand piled on one another\nhide the former sands, so in life the events which go before are soon covered by those which come after.\"\n\"Speak both in the senate and to every man, whoever he may be, appropriately, not with any affectation: use plain discourse.\"\n\"Now it is true that these [obstacles] may impede my action, but they are no impediments to my affects and disposition, which have the power of acting conditionally and changing: for the mind converts and changes every hindrance to its activity into an aid; and so that which is a hindrance is made a furtherance to an act; and that which is an obstacle on the road helps us on this road.\"\nnon-fiction\n \nphilosophy\nLuís\n2,270 reviews\n1,171 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nMarch 25, 2025\nOf course, this is not the most delicate philosophy. However, I still enjoyed taking my time to soak up some thoughts before moving on to others more quickly.\nI recommend reading only the Epitectus manual from which Marcus Aurelius' thoughts were drawn. In any case (since it seems that we should remember it), the study of Marcus Aurelius is nothing innovative; it is a question of integrated stoicism implemented by an individual with an extraordinary destiny.\nHowever, we must not neglect the benefactor side of this philosophy and its \"reference\" side. Whether you subscribe to it, you must know it to go further in philosophy and life.\nThis work is classic and straightforward and opens the doors to great thoughts.\n2021-readings\n \nbiography\n \ne-3\n \n...more\nMark  Porton\n569 reviews\n701 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nNovember 27, 2022\nMarcus Aurelius (121 – 180 CE) was the last in line of the five good Emperors (Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus). \nFun Fact 1: funny thing is, they were all adopted by their predecessor. The next Emperor after Marcus was Commodus, he was a son of Marcus and was a complete Muppet, nasty too – hence the start of a period of volatility after his death. An argument against hereditary ascension to a throne to be sure. This is not the only instance of hereditary ascension being a complete disaster in the Roman Empire.\nMarcus Aurelius – didn’t he look curious?\nNow Marcus was not only the guy in charge of the Roman Empire he was a Stoic Philosopher. I am a tad conflicted about an Emperor being a Stoic. In my mind a Stoic, is calm, happy with his or her lot, does not want for much, but on the other hand an Emperor is grab, grab, grab and kill, kill, kill. When he wrote this – he was on the frontline of the war with the Germanic Tribes in 170-180 CE. So that does not lie straight with me – however, he did not live lavishly.....apparently. But to be fair, he was part of a machine, and in charge of it – he could very well have been (and I believe it to be so) a decent, intelligent man.\nEither way \nMeditations\n is a piece of work that endures to this day. Imagine that it still holds up. Meditations was first printed in 1559 CE; Marcus originally wrote this work in Greek – the language of the intelligentsia of the time. It is also believed; these writings were not intended to be published. He wrote these for himself. Yes, just he – and we have been gorking at these writings for centuries – academics and lay people alike – it is respected, it has stood up. \nDon’t you think that is amazing?\nYou cannot finish a book like this – it needs to be kept on one’s bedside table, to be referred to every now and then, maybe scribble your own notes (while listening to Enya) and reflect. This is what I do with my favourite Stoic work by one of my heroes – Seneca – his work \nOn the Shortness of Life\n is my favourite. My review of this classic can be found here \nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9...\n. So, Seneca’s and Marcus’ books are in my Man Bag. Stick them in yours too!!!!! Or handbag of you are a lady 😊\nFun Fact 2: Seneca tutored young Nero, yeah yeah - he stuffed up there, but let's be stoic about this and lay it to one side.\nNow the edition of Meditations I have in my possession, and totally recommend, is the Penguin Classics edition, translated with notes by Martin Hammond. The notes take up half of this publication and explain each of Marcus’ meditations. Yes, each one. What was happening, where he was and what he may have been thinking. Here is an example:\nBook 6 (there are 10 – they are like chapters)\nAll that exists will soon change. Either it will be turned into vapour, if all matter is a unity, or it will be scattered in atoms.\nNote 6.4 – ‘Turned into vapour’ reflects the Stoic conflagration of the universe (see notes 2.14.2 and 5.13). ‘Scattered into atoms’ is the Epicurean view\nNow, with this type of format – you (if you read it) will be flipping back and forth, checking this and that, googling, researching getting bogged down and learning heaps. Or one can just read it and think.\nThere is so much here, written by a true GIANT of antiquity.

A few gems that stood out to me for their finesse and profoundness are:\n\"All is ephemeral, both memory and the object of memory\" (Book 4, para. 37)\n\"There is a river of creation, and time is the violent stream...\"(Book 4, para. 43)\n\"Observe the movement of the stars as if you were running their courses with them, and let your mind constantly dwell on the changes of the elements into each other.\" (Book 7, para. 47)\n\"You should leave another's wrong where it lies\" (Book 9, para. 20)\n\"Nature gives all and takes back all.\" (Book 10, para. 14)\n\"'No nature is inferior to art': in fact the arts imitate the variety of natures.\" (Book 11, para. 10)\n In truth I could easily spend hours meditating on a single line of Meditations. In fact, what is most remarkable is that the advice contained in this book is still applicable to our modern way of life, after almost 2 millennia. \nMy only minor quibble with Meditations is that at times I found it repetitive (hence the 4 ⭐ rating). Although this was explained in the Introduction as a way in which Aurelius sought to reinforce and ingrain the principles that he was expounding. \nMeditations is certainly a book that I will revisit in the future and I will definitely recommend it to anyone seeking inspiration and direction in their life.\nphilosophy\nPhyllis Eisenstadt\n48 reviews\n98 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nDecember 19, 2015\nTHINK ABOUT IT!\nNever before have I given a five star rating to a book of which I had only read 9%. However, this book is special in many ways, and if the beginning is any indication of the author's thoughts and reflections, it merits this rating. I eagerly await my future readings of this splendid work.\nLike the Bible, it can be opened to any page, and the passage will resonate with most people at various times in their life. Each passage stands by itself and is not dependent upon what had preceded it. Therefore, although I am in the midst of reading two other books, I pick this one up sporadically, read a few passages, and am not confused about plot and characters. Although the book was written in a manner easy to understand, it is anything but simplistic; it is profound and replete with wisdom. Further, it should be read slowly so that the reader may absorb the words and delight in the meditations of Aurelius. I have done much highlighting in order to remember certain passages, and I know I will reread them throughout the years.\nOnce again, my friend Steve Sckenda has recommended quality literature to his GR friends for which I thank him most sincerely.\nPhyllis Eisenstadt\nJan-Maat\n1,653 reviews\n2,373 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nRead\nSeptember 26, 2021\nAh I had a far better review in my mind, but it has, like morning mist, cleared out from my mind leaving a jumble of words and impressions, so you will have to endure that, or skip to another GR update instead :)\nThe weaknesses of Marcus Aurelius's jottings and musings, his inconsistencies, vaguenesses, intellectual messiness, the lack of exploration of any particular idea in detail are it's strengths. There is a Marcus Aurelius for everyone, or perhaps for everyday of the year (\nSelections from the Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius for every day in the year\n) (and I suspect there are Marcus Aurelius day by day calendars). I wondered if at some point the \nreal\n Marcus Aurelius would stand up, and of course he does, just like Spartacus at the end of the Stanley Kubrik \nfilm\n.\nThe work known variously as Meditations or the Golden Book was originally written in Greek and entitled 'To Himself', it is divided into twelve 'books' each perhaps fifteen or so printed pages in length. The first book is a listing of to whom and for what Marcus Aurelius is grateful - for things like his upbringing and character rather than that people pay their taxes and, by and large, obey the laws. The other eleven books don't have any thematic unity. At the end of the first book he writes: \n'Among the Quadi, on the river Gran'\n this is the only indication of time and place in the entire work which is good from the point of view of approachability, Yes, you too, and me, have direct access to the personal musing of a Roman Emperor you can read his blogging, indeed in places almost his tweets, there is no barrier you can approach him with out prior knowledge - people have approached him with out prior knowledge for almost 2,000 years, so much so that I fear there is little novel here: be grateful, practise serenity, be kind to others, appreciate the order and structure of life, do your duty (like a Roman). The downside is you don't learn much about Marcus Aurelius, it is somehow so personal, private and interior that it has become indistinct and universal, suitable for fridge magnets or motivational posters anywhere.\nI believe that formally Marcus was a a stoic, if his reflections in his book represent cutting edge stoic philosophy or the ponderings of a well educated individual of his day I don't know. In book eleven particularly he quotes Homer, Sophocles, Euripides and Plato, but he never mentions the famous Roman stoic Seneca. Perhaps Seneca was already forgotten by Aurelius' time or perhaps the issue of how to behave under the rule of an emperor was a bit too close to the bone for the Emperor.\nAs I mentioned in updates it reminded me in its stress on duty of what I have heard of the Bhagadvad Gita and I felt that Aurelius' : Worldnature, nature, world reason, cosmic purpose, gods, universal nature,mind of the universe, god... (a sample of the terms he seems to use for some kind of ordering principle in the universe) could all have been expressed as, or were reaching towards ideas of Dharma or Dao. Since this is a philosophical work, of sorts, or perhaps a religious one, I wondered if the translation was unhelpful - perhaps all these terms might have been rendered by one expression in the original, perhaps Logos (most famous now from the opening of the Gospel of Saint John), yet I think I read in the introduction that Marcus did use all these different terms even though, contextually they all appear to mean something similar if not identical.\nGiven this and the \nTao Te Ching\n, I would have imagined that the \n Tao Te Ching\n was the one written by a canny Emperor, Marcus somehow often manages to sound like a harassed corporate drone forced to share a workbench with people who don't brush their teeth and who wash and change their clothes regularly - meaning once every nine weeks - (5:28) I could imagine it as the basis for a new US Sit-Com, maybe \nAurelius: the customer service years\n, a slight change from his previous appearances in the films \nThe Fall of the Roman Empire\n and \nGladiator\n both of which downplay quite how odd Marcus' son the Emperor \nCommodus \nwas \n he enjoyed dressing up (or down?) as Hercules and clubbing people with his club, he had all the months renamed after himself, still it was only after twelve years that he was strangled by his personal trainer \n I have long been of the opinion that sport is bad for you, but in truth maybe it is just personal trainers \n.\nMarcus says that he thinks praying for three hours a day is sufficient, but it was unclear to me quite what he would be praying to, his universe otherwise seems fairly deterministic and the gods a part of that as much as the fig trees, horses and people, perhaps his prayer was more his spiritual practise to encourage the serenity, kindness, and indifference to death that he speaks of rather than requests to the gods.\nWalking wet pavements observing (stoically of course) the flashes of lightening over the sky, I wondered if death and being forgotten (everybody who ever knew you also dying) was such a constant preoccupation in these writing because it was a prospect that he really feared, as it has happened this has preserved his memory fairly effectively.\nEverything\n he says \nis created for some duty\n (8:19) even if we accept that this is so and easily definable for his examples of a horse and a vine, the question that he does not address is what about an Emperor? Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero were all emperors and all acted as though they had different conceptions of duty. But Marcus while exposing his innermost thoughts does not want to reveal what he thought his own duty as an Emperor was. For me it was not a case of \nHowards end is no the landing\n but Marcus Aurelius was on the dusty shelf, picked up for two GBP I don't recall when, probably in disreputable company.\nAt the same time I can not be completely comfortable with him. \nMine [my concern], to be in friendship and charity with all men\n (11:13) he writes while fighting wars against the Marcomanni, Quadi and Samatians, so friendship and charity with not quite all men, I flicked through the relevant pages of \n Empires and Barbarians\n and saw that war began because they asked if they could enter the empire and had been refused, perhaps I am missing something here, also this was a period when punishments for crimes became harsher for those of lower social status, his self cultivation and personal serenity did not come into conflict with a conception of imperial duty that seems in practise to have been heavy handed (\nkindness is irresistible\n but he is partial to the decapitation of his enemies), perhaps for him there was no contradiction, he was no Ashokha (he says somewhere that you either have to improve people or put up with them, he does not seem to have tried improving them, that was not his duty). But his writings don't clarify his approach to authority and rule to me \n my guess would be that for him non-Romans and lower class Romans - humiliores as they were called in distinction to the higher class honestiores did not count as full people but were a lower type of thing like horses and vines and therefore to be broken or pruned, but since few of us these days are Roman emperors we can maybe misread his words with a fraternal spirit, if a fig tree will (in good conditions) produce figs, so too a Roman Emperor will be a Roman Emperor \n.\nI see here Marcus Aurelius for business: \nMeditations: Thoughts for Corporate Dominance\n this from the man who wrote (5:33) \n\"all that men set their hearts on in this life is vanity, corruption and trash...\"\n2nd-century\n \nautobiography-memoir\n \nclassical-and-late-antiquity\n \n...more\nInfinite Jen\n96 reviews\n823 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nMarch 26, 2023\nWhy do I always posit bizarre questions at the beginning of every review?

At a time like this, a powerful aphorism could save you. \nThe following apocryphal tale is how the last emperor of the Pax Romana riveted my stray quintessence back to my pineal gland using the pithy wisdom of The Meditations as adhesive. Giving me the incredible strength required to consume an entire box of grape popsicles, which in turn, carried me away from the jaws of psychosis on high fructose wings.\nBelow the balcony.

What a guy.\nThis is another very important book to me. It’s message, contrary to conflations of stoicism with pure apathy, is this: The narrow band of experience, which comprises the entire trajectory of your life, is bracketed by voids of unknown dimensions. So in every sense, what you do here, in this blip of astronomical time, matters. Possessing this knowledge, how should we behave in the face of life’s travails? Despair and give ourselves to the comforting cowardice of nihilism? Or bear, with dignity, our one and only experiential opportunity in this absurd system?\nThis book contains the rumination’s of an emperor, a philosopher, and, most pertinent to our collective struggles, a fellow mortal, aware of their paltry chronological endowment. Trying to live well and love fully. Seeking to define goodness and hone the pursuit of it as earnestly as possible. Espousing the virtues of self reliance, of facing hardship with equanimity, of treating others with respect and compassion. Stressing the importance of habituating your thoughts in ways that are productive, rather than adopting fatalistic narratives. It’s a panacea against carping and catastrophizing. A set of conceptual triangulations to steady you in times when you feel unmoored. Succor in menacing shadow of life’s impermanence.\nIt is fashionable to consider all works of philosophy to be stodgy and concerned with matters so esoteric that little practical value can be derived them. But this book chiefly concerns (by heavy dent of the Roman preoccupation with pragmatism, one imagines) the concrete ways in which a life of the mind can provide a bulwark against turmoil and tragedy. I encourage you to give it a chance, you might find yourself surprised by the power of ideas, and the fortitude of a life well lived.\nGabrielle (Reading Rampage)\n1,144 reviews\n1,659 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nJanuary 7, 2020\nMarcus Aurelius was a Stoic, a philosophy that is all about accepting the present moment as it is, and not letting the struggle to get away from pain and to acquire pleasure dictate our lives. This philosophy has always appealed to me, and obviously there are many similarities with Zen Buddhism to be found in Stoicism. This little book is the equivalent of a little diary one would keep on their nightstand, where they would scribble thoughts that they want to remind themselves of, and as the title implies, insight gained from looking deep into oneself.\nWhile it can get a bit repetitive sometimes, and can, at times, feel like ideas we’ve heard a million times before, there is something profoundly soothing and inspiring in Marcus Aurelius’ little maxims: they are a refreshing reminder that leading a life of simplicity and compassion can be a much more rewarding life than one based on greed and superficial, fleeting satisfactions. If it feels oddly familiar, it’s probably because people have been quoting Marcus Aurelius for hundreds of years!\nHe wrote most of these late in his life, and there are plenty of reflections on death in these pages: that is certainly explained in part by how old he was when he took up the pen, but it was also an important part of Stoic philosophy, to be aware that life is finite, and that we should therefore learn to be satisfied with how it is right now, as it could be gone tomorrow.\nWhen you consider the tone of the thoughts collected in “Meditations”, it can be surprising to remember that they were written down by the most powerful man of the Western world. Would powerful men today write so earnestly about dignity, thoughtfulness, modesty and honesty? Would they encourage people to truly look at themselves and give up caring about the things that are outside of our control? I don’t know. But Marcus was very aware of his humanity, and therefore, that even if he was the Emperor, he was fundamentally not all that different from other people.\nJust like when I read Cicero last year (\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\n), I finished this book wishing this was still a mandatory text: it's not perfect, but there is some important wisdom in here, and I wish more people were exposed to this kind of writing. And it is still incredibly relevant, and applicable to many daily life situations.\nA very good book to start the new year (and decade!) with.\n\"If someone can prove me wrong and show me my mistake in any thought or action, I shall gladly change. I seek the truth, which never harmed anyone: the harm is to persist in one's own self-deception and ignorance.\"\n\"Perfection of character is this: to live each day as if it were your last, without frenzy, without apathy, without pretense.\"\nclassics\n \nhistorical\n \nown-a-copy\n \n...more\nWalter\n33 reviews\n10 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nDecember 4, 2007\nAnother great influence in my life; this was the personal philosophical diary of the last \"good emperor\" of the Roman Empire. In this work Marcus Aurelius draws a picture Stoicism as a philosophy that I call \"Buddhism with balls\". It is a harsh self discipline that trains its practitioners to be champions (of a sort). Champions of what? Mastery of the self. \nThe heart of the book is that in order to make oneself free, they must train themselves to become indifferent to externals. The externals are those elements in life of which we have no or little control: our ethnicity, sex appeal, intelligence, lifespan, the opinions of others, etc. We must also become very aware of the one thing which we do have control over: our perceptions. Through harsh self analysis, training of the reason and self discipline, we can learn to take control of our perceptions, and in this way become impervious to all misfortune/suffering. Through this practice one cuts the puppet strings by which most people are jerked through life: pleasing others, seeking fame, sexual dominance, material goods, etc., and in the process also is freed of the suffering that stems from not having these false goals met.\nThis is a book that is extremely empowering. Even if some of the ideals and aims might be utterly impossible (but for a handful of great sages), they are worthy and worth striving towards. \nAnother aspect that I found interesting, was that here we are able to open a window into the life of a great and noble soul who was struggling to come to terms with the universe. We read the personal thoughts of the master of the civilized world, a man utterly alone and free of peers, who is grappling with the need to find meaning in life. His efforts and obvious agonies are touching. This is a deeply humane work. In many sections he has to repeatedly remind himself of the nature of death (that it is an essential and good part of nature), and often repeated are metaphors relating to the death of a child. These reminders are made very poignant when you understand that several of the Emperor's children (who he apparently loved very much) were taken by disease. This was the one understanding that he seemed to have the hardest time coming to terms with or accepting.\n \nKrishna Chaitanya\n68 reviews\n118 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nOctober 7, 2020\n\"If you want to gain control of pain,\nopen up this blessed book\nand enter deep within it.\nIts wealth of philosophy will bring you\nto see with ease all the future,\nthe present, and the past,\nand you will see that joy and distress\nhave no more power than smoke.\" - One of Marcus' Greek readers.\n2020\n \nclassics\n \nnonfiction\n \n...more\nSara\nAuthor \n1 book\n858 followers\nFollow\nFollow\nFebruary 11, 2020\nWritten between the years 170 and 180 while on campaign, Marcus Aurelius' work Meditations is one of the most enduring works of philosophy ever penned by man. I read this book very slowly, in an attempt to absorb the wisdom and instruction within its pages, but it will take more than one reading to do that, for every word has meaning and impact. Why is this not required reading in our schools? It could easily teach our children everything they will ever need to know to navigate life well and live in happiness and peace. \nJust a few of the more poignant and meaningful quotations from this work (although I could have abandoned these and selected ten others which were just as good):\n1. Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.\n2.The happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.\n3.Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.\n4. Dwell upon the beauty of life. Watch the stars and see yourself running with them.\n5. If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.\n6. Our life is what our thoughts make it.\n7. It is not death a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.\n8. If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.\n9. How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.\n10. How ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life.\nThat Marcus Aurelius was one of the “five good emperors” does not surprise me. I had never thought that I would have found any joy in being a stoic, but I believe living your life according to the precepts he puts forward would bring both joy and peace. I will be re-reading The Meditations over the course of this year, one panel a night before going to bed seems like a good practice, to remind myself, as Marcus Aurelius was reminding himself, that a good life is found internally, not externally.\nclassics\n \ngutenberg-download\n \nmore-than-5-stars\n \n...more\nDisplaying 1 - 30 of 17,780 reviews\nMore reviews and ratings\nJoin the discussion\n2,901\nquotes\n53\ndiscussions\n22\nquestions\nCan't find what you're looking for?\nGet help and learn more about the design.\nHelp center",

But we cannot fairly judge of their epistolary style from these alone. Philostratus says\n1\n that “in his opinion the best letter writers for style were .... of kings the deified Marcus in the letters he wrote himself, for the firmness (τὸ ἐδραῖον) of his character was reflected in his writing by his choice of language; and of orators Herodes the Athenian, though by his over-atticism and prolixity\n2\n he often oversteps the bounds proper to the epistolary style.”\n\n\nMarcus was a prolific letter-writer. According to Capitolinus\n3\n he defended himself against calumny by letters. To his friends he sometimes, as we see below, wrote three times in one day. On one occasion he tells us that he had dictated thirty letters,\n4\n but these were probably official correspondence. Nearly \n200\n of his imperial rescripts are extant, which though interesting would be out of place here. Many are in\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nEptistles\n, p. 364, Kayser.\n2\nWe have only one letter of hie, and it certainly is not prolix, for it consists of but one word, ἐμάνης, addressed to Avidius Cassius when he revolted.\n3\nVit. Mar\n. xxii. 6; xxix. 6; \ncp\n. xxiii. 7, 9.\n4\nSee i. p. 185.\n289\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFind related works\nMarcus Aurelius\nLatin Library\n100 AD – 200 AD\nProse\nLetters\n\n\n\n\nDOI: 10.4159/DLCL.marcus_aurelius-miscellaneous_letters.1920",

But we cannot fairly judge of their epistolary style from these alone. Philostratus says\n that \"in his opinion the best letter writers for style were \n. . . .\n of kings the deified Marcus in the letters he wrote himself, for the firmness (\nτὸ ἑδραῖον\n) of his character was reflected in his writing by his choice of language; and of orators Herodes the Athenian, though by his over-atticism and prolixity\n he often oversteps the bounds proper to the epistolary style.\" \n\nMarcus was a prolific letter-writer. According to Capitolinus\n he defended himself against calumny by letters. To his friends he sometimes, as we see below, wrote three times in one day. On one occasion he tells us that he had dictated thirty letters,\n but these were probably official correspondence. Nearly 200 of his imperial rescripts are extant, which though interesting would be out of place here. Many are in \n​\nthe form of letters.\n They contain characteristic sayings such as \"No one has a right to let his own negligence prejudice others\";\n \"Let those who have charge of our interests know that the cause of liberty is to be set before any pecuniary advantage to ourselves\";\n \"It would not be consistent with humanity to delay the enfranchisement of a slave for the sake of pecuniary gain\";\n \"It would seem beyond measure unfair that a husband should insist upon a chastity from his wife which he does not practise himself\";\n \"Nothing must be done contrary to local custom.\" \n\nIn answer to Ulpius Eurycles,\n \ncurator\n of Ephesus, asking what should be done with old decayed statues of preceding emperors in the Ephesian senate house, we find the interesting pronouncement, \"There must be no re-working of the material into likenesses of us. For as we are not in other respects solicitous of honours for ourselves, much less should we permit those of others to be transferred to us. As many of the statues as are in good preservation should be kept under their original names, but with respect to those that are too battered to be identified, perhaps their titles can be recovered from inscriptions on their bases or from records that may exist in the possession of the Council, so that our progenitors may rather receive a renewal of their honour than \n​\nits extinction through the melting down of their images.\" \n\nThere are, besides, two or three inscriptions and one papyrus, all much mutilated,\n recording letters or rescripts of Marcus, one in 163 to Pontius Laelianus, consul of that year. It contains a rare word \nγλωσσόκομον\n rejected by Phrynichus.\n\n\nBesides the above there are extant only two letters or parts of letters that are certainly genuine. Following these are two letters from Christian sources, the letter to Euxenianus Publio with respect to Abercius, bishop of Hieropolis, and the letter to the Senate purporting to give a report of the \"Miraculous Victory\" over the Quadi. The fact of the victory with the unexpected salvation of the Roman army is certain, but the heathen writers attribute it to the prayers of the emperor or the incantations of an Egyptian magician. \n\nAfter these two letters come ten short epistles, or parts of such, which would be of considerable interest if their authenticity were established. Till comparatively lately they were accepted unquestioningly, and afforded material for charges against Marcus. They are all found in the \nScriptores Historiae Augustae\n, a late compilation of the fourth Century, intended as a supplement to Suetonius's \nLives of the Caesars\n, and attributed to various authors. \n\nBut in spite of Renan and Waddington and Naber and others, who have quoted them as evidence, they cannot be regarded as genuine. They contain several \n​\nlater words, and their style is rhetorical and unworthy of the subjects treated. The puerile playing upon words, \nAvidius\n \n. . .\n \navidus\n, etc. betrays their artificial character. Writing of Cassius, the general who conducted the Parthian war to a successful conclusion and afterwards in 175 rebelled against Marcus, the latter is represented as quoting \nγνῶμαι\n from Suetonius instead of giving his own opinions. Moreover facts mentioned in the letters are at variance with what is known from other sources. For instance, Marcus was not in or near Rome in 175, as required by the Faustina correspondence; nor was Pompeianus, his son-law, consul in 176; nor was Lucius ever spoken of as grandson of Pius, but always as his son and the brother of Marcus; nor could Fadilla in 175 be alluded to as \npuella virgo\n, for by that time she would have been twenty-five and almost certainly married.\n\nIt is also incredible that Avidius Cassius should have contemplated revolt, and so openly as to arouse definite suspicions in the mind of Verus, so long before the actual outbreak. We know from Fronto's letters\n that Verus and Cassius were on excellent terms as late as 165, and Fronto's own letter\n to him shews the estimation in which he was then held. When Cassius revolted, Marcus felt it deeply as the defection of a friend.\n Equally rhetorical and fictitious is a letter said to be from Cassius to his son-in-law:\n \"Marcus is assuredly an excellent man, but while he covets a reputation for clemency, he lets those live whose lives he does not approve. Where is Lucius Cassius, whose name I bear in vain? \n​\nWhere the great Marcus Cato the Censor? Where all the discipline of our ancestors? Marcus Antoninus philosophizes and enquires about first principles and about the soul and about what is honourable and just, and has no thought for the State\n \n. . . . .\n You have heard of the \npraefectus praetorio\n of our philosopher, who was a beggarly pauper three days before he was appointed, but has suddenly become rich—whence, pray, if not from the vitals of the State and the property of the provincials?\n Well, let them be rich, let them be opulent: they will serve to fill the public treasury.\" By a commonplace of the rhetorical schools Cassius in another passage is made to liken himself to Catiline and Marcus to the \ndialogista\n (Cicero).\n\n\nHowever there are some touches in the correspondence which are true to character, such as the words attributed to Lucius, \"I do not hate the man,\" which are in keeping with his well-known \nbonitas\n, and the \"Perish my children\" of Marcus, which he might well have said. But he is not likely to have quoted Suetonius or Horace, to the latter of whom he took a dislike\n in his younger days. The fabricator of the letters was perhaps Aemilius Parthenianus, a writer of the third or fourth century. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n​\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS LETTERS OF MARCUS AURELIUS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus to the Guild of Dionysus Briseus at Smyrna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 28, 147 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius Caesar\n, son of the Emperor Caesar Titus Aelius Adrianus Augustus, Father of his country, invested with Tribunitian Power, Consul for the second time, to the Synod of the Guild of Dionysus Briseus, greeting: \n\nYour good will which you shewed in congratulating me on the birth of a son,\n even though the issue belied our hopes, was none the less manifest. \n\nT. Atilius Maximus, the most honourable proconsul and our friend, inscribed the decree. \n\nI wish you farewell: from Lorium, the 28th March. \n\nThe inscription was made by M. Antonius Artemas, Sulpicius Rufinus being honorary treasurer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus and Herodes Atticus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n176 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter\n the events in Pannonia\n Herodes lived in Attica in his favourite denies of Marathon and \n​\nCephisia,\n attended by young men from every quarter, who travelled to Athens from a desire to hear his oratory. \n\nWishing to make trial whether Marcus was angry with him owing to what had occurred at the trial,\n he sent him a letter not containing excuses but a complaint, for he said that \"he wondered for what reason Marcus no longer wrote to him, though in times past he wrote so often that on one occasion three letter-carriers reached him on a single day, one treading on the heels of another.\" \n\nAnd the Emperor at greater length and on greater subjects, and putting a wonderful amount of character into the letter, sent an answer to Herodes, from which I will extract what bears upon my present subject and quote it. The letter opened with the words \"Hail, my dear Herodes\"; and after speaking of his winter quarters after the war, in which he was at the time, and lamenting the wife whom he had lately lost,\n and saying something also about his bodily weakness, he went on as follows: \"But for you I pray that you may have good health, and may think of me as your well-wisher and not consider yourself wronged because, detecting some of your household in wrong-doings, I punished them in the mildest way possible. Be not angry with me on this account, but, if I have done you, or am doing you, any injury, ask satisfaction of me in the temple of Athena-in-the-City\n during the Mysteries. For I \n​\nvowed, when the war\n was at its hottest, that I would be initiated, and I hope you will be my sponsor on the occasion.\" \n\nSuch was Marcus's plea for himself, at once so kindly and so manly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus to Euxenianus Publio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n? 163–164 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\n Emperor Antoninus Augustus to Euxenianus Publio, greeting: \n\nHaving had experience of your sagacity in your works themselves, and especially in those which you carried out by order of our authority in respect to Smyrna in alleviating the calamity that befell the Smyrniotes owing to the earthquake\n there, I have been pleased, as was natural, and praise you for your diligence in carrying out these duties. For I have been apprized of everything exactly as if I had been present. For everything has been clearly recounted to me by the report sent from you, and by him who presented it, and by Caecilius the procurator. But with respect to the present matter, it has come to the knowledge of our power that a certain Abercius,\n bishop of Hieropolis, is living in your jurisdiction, a \n​\nman of such sanctity among the Christians as both to cure those who are possessed by demons\n and easily heal all other diseases. Having imperative need of him we have sent Valerius and Bassianus representatives of our officials for sacred things, to bring the man to us with all reverence and honour. Accordingly we bid you with your usual firmness to persuade him to come to us with all speed, and you know that this, too, will gain for you no little praise from us. Farewell. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Letter\n \nof the Emperor Marcus to the Senate in which he testifies that the Christians were the Cause of the Victory of the Romans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n? 174 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. The Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Germanicus Parthicus Sarmaticus\n to the People of the Romans and the Sacred Senate, greeting: \n\nI made known\n to you the greatness of my enterprize, and what things I did in Germany after the critical occasion of my being hemmed in on the frontier, in dire distress and suffering, when I was \n​\nsurprised in Cotinum by seventy-four regiments from nine miles away. Our scouts informed us when they had come near us, and Pompeianus, our commander, shewed us what we also saw for ourselves—for I had been suddenly surrounded by a huge and savage multitude while having with me a composite and moderate force drawn from the First legion and the Tenth (both the Twin and the Fretensian)—that there were masses of men in a miscellaneous host numbering 977,000. \n\n2. When, therefore, I compared myself and my numbers with the immense hordes of the barbarian enemy, I took refuge in prayer to the Gods of our fathers. But being disregarded by them, and looking at the straits to which my force was reduced, I called upon those whom we name Christians—and by enquiry I found out the greatness of their numbers—going so far as to inveigh against them, which I ought not to have done, for I afterwards learnt their power. \n\n3. They then starting with this (bethought them of) no equipment of missiles or arms or trumpets, since this is hateful to them by reason of the God that they bear in their conscience. It is likely, then, that they whom we suppose to be godless have a self-acting God entrenched in their conscience. For casting themselves on the ground they prayed, not for me alone, but also for the whole army, that He would relieve our present drought and famine. For we had taken no water for five days, as there was none to be had, for we were in the very heart of Germany and far within their frontiers. As soon as they had cast themselves on the ground, and prayed to a God \n​\nwhom I knew not, straightway there came water from heaven, the coolest of rain upon us, but upon the enemies of Rome fiery hail. So straightway was revealed to us at once, as they prayed, the presence of their God, as of one omnipotent and everlasting. \n\n4. From this moment, therefore, let us allow such persons to be Christians, lest by praying they obtain such weapons against us. And I propose that no such person be accused on the ground of his being a Christian. But, if anyone be found accusing the Christian for being a Christian, I wish it to be made clear that the Christian who is brought to trial should be (acquitted), if he confesses himself to be a Christian, and no other charge is brought against him except that he is a Christian, but that his accuser shall be burnt alive;\n and the Governor who is set over the province must not force to recant or deprive of his liberty the Christian who confesses that he is one, and is credited. \n\n5. My will is that this should be ratified by a decree of the Senate, and I direct that this my edict be published in Trajan's Forum, that it-may be o^pen to all to read it. The prefect Vitrasius Pollio\n will see to it that it is sent throughout the provinces. Anyone who wishes to appeal to it and to have it by him must not be prevented from obtaining a copy from the official gazette of our decrees. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n​\n\n\nLetter of Marcus to his\n \nPraefectus\n (\npraetorio\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n? 162–163 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have\n put Avidius Cassius in command of the Syrian army which is dissolved in luxury and living in the moral atmosphere of Daphne.\n Caesonius Vectilianus described them as indulging wholesale in hot baths. And I think I have done right, for you too must have noted Cassius, a man of the old Cassian severity and discipline. Nor indeed can soldiers be ruled except by the ancient discipline. For you know that line of an excellent poet, which is in the mouths of all: \n\n\n\n\n\nRome on her ancient ways and men unshakably standeth\n..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have only to see that the troops are plentifully provided . with supplies. If I know anything of Cassius\n I am certain they will not be wasted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer of the Praefect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n? 162–163 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\n have taken a wise step, my Lord, in setting Cassius over the Syrian army. There is nothing so salutary for grecianized soldiers as a man of unusual strictness. Be sure that he will \"knock off\" all these hot baths for the soldiers, these flowers \n​\nfrom their heads and necks and breasts. The soldiers' corn-supply is all provided, and nothing is wanting with a good general in command, for his requirements and his expenses are equally moderate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a Letter of Verus to Marcus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n? 166 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvidius Cassius\n, if my judgment counts for anything, is avid for empire, as was already patent under my grandfather,\n your father. I would have you keep a watchful eye upon him. He dislikes our whole regime; he is gathering great wealth; he ridicules our letters; he calls you a philosophizing old woman, me a profligate simpleton. See what had better be done. Personally I do not dislike the man; but you must consider whether you are acting fairly by yourself and your children in keeping ready equipped for action such a leader as the soldiers gladly listen to, gladly see. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer of Marcus about Avidius Cassius\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n? 166 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have\n read your letter, which savours more of the alarmist than the Imperator, and is out of keeping with the times. For if the empire is destined by heaven for Cassius we shall not be able to put him to death, however much we may desire it. You know your great-grandfather's saying, \nNo one ever killed his own successor\n.\n But if the empire is not so destined, \n​\nhe will himself of his own accord, without any harsh measures on our part, be caught in the toils of Fate, let alone the fact that we cannot treat as a criminal a man whom no one impeaches and, as you say, the soldiers love. Besides, in cases of high treason, it is inevitable that even those who are proved guilty should seem to be victims of oppression. For you know yourself what your grandfather Hadrian said: \nWretched indeed is the lot of princes, who only by being slain can persuade the world that they have been conspired against!\n I have preferred to father the remark on him rather than Domitian, who is said to have made it first, for in the mouths of tyrants even fine sayings do not carry as much weight as they ought. \n\nLet Cassius then go his own way, more especially as he is an excellent general, strict and brave and indispensable to the State. For as to what you say that the interests of my children should be safe-guarded by his death, frankly, may my children perish, if Avidius deserves to be loved more than they, and if it be better for the State that Cassius should survive than the children of Marcus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Aurelius Antoninus to his Praefects,\n Greeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n169–172 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Albinus,\n of the family of the Ceionii, an African indeed but with not much of the African in him, the son-in-law of Plautillus, I have given the command of two cavalry cohorts. He is a man who has \n​\nseen service, is of austere life and serious character. I think that his appointment will be of advantage to the army; that it will not be disadvantageous, I am sure. I have granted him double allowances, a simple military robe, but four times the pay of his rank. Exhort him to shew himself a pattern to the State for he is assured a reward equal to his tleserts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a Letter about Albinus written by Marcus during the Rebellion of Avidius Cassius\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n175–176 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\n loyalty of Albinus is worthy of all praise in that he kept to their allegiance troops that were seriously disaffected, when they were ready to go over to Cassius. And had he not been on the spot, the defection would have been general. In him then we have a man worthy of the consulship, and I will appoint him in the room of Cassius Papirius, who, as I have just been told, is dying. But I would rather not have this appointment made public at present, that it may not get to the ears of Papirius himself or his relations, lest we seem to have elected a consul to take the place of one who is still alive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Antoninus to Cornelius Balbus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCirca\n 178 (?) \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\n praise Pescennius\n1 to me. I am not surprised, for your predecessor also spoke of him as energetic in action, serious in character, and even \n​\nthen more than a mere soldier. And so I have sent a letter to be read to the troops, in which I have given him the command of three hundred Armenians and a hundred Sarmatians and a thousand regulars. It is your part to shew that the man has reached this rank, which my grandfather Hadrian and my great-grandfather Trajan reserved for the most tried soldiers, not by partiality, which is abhorrent to our principles, but by merit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus to Faustina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n175 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerus\n was verity itself when he wrote to me of Cassius that he coveted the empire. For I suppose you have heard what news messengers brought of him yesterday. So come to Albanum\n that by the Gods' goodwill we may deal with the situation, and do not be alarmed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaustina to Marcus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n175 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will\n come myself as you suggest to Albanum to-morrow. But in the meantime I urge you, as you love your children, take the severest measures against these rebels. For the morale of generals and soldiers is thoroughly bad, and unless you crush them they will crush us. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n​\nMy mother Faustina exhorted your father Pius, on the revolt of [the same] Celsus, that he should shew loyalty in the first place to his own family and then to others. For an Emperor cannot be called Pius who does not think of wife and children. You see how young our Commodus is: Pompeianus, our son-in-law,\n is both aged and a provincial. See how you deal with Avidius Cassius and his accomplices. Spare not men who have not spared you, and would have spared neither me nor your children, had they succeeded. I will myself soon follow you on your journey. As our Fadilla\n was ill, I could not come to the Formian Villa.\n But if I cannot find you at Formiae, I will go on to Capua, a place which is likely to benefit my health and our childrens'. I beseech you send Soteridas the physician to the Formian Villa. I have no faith in Pisitheus, who does not know how to cure our little maid.\n Calpurnius gave me the sealed letter to which I will send an answer. If I fail to get it off at once, by Caecilius the old eunuch, a man, as you know, to be relied on, I will entrust him with an oral message of what the wife of Avidius Cassius and his children and son-in-law are reported to say about you. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer of Marcus to Faustina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n175 \nA.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anxiety which you shew for your husband and our children, my Faustina, is natural. For I have \n​\nread your letter again in the Formian Villa, in which you urge me to take vengeance on the accomplices of Cassius. But I intend to spare his children and son-in-law and wife,\n and I shall write to the Senate not to permit any severer persecution or harsher penalty being inflicted on them. For there is nothing that can commend an emperor to the world more than clemency. It was clemency that made Caesar into a God, that deified Augustus, that honoured your father with the distinctive title of Pius.\n Finally, if my wishes had been followed in respect to the war, not even Cassius would have been slain. So do not be troubled: \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gods protect me, to the Gods my loyalty is dear\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have named our Pompeianus\n consul for the ensuing year. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nEpistles\n, p. 364, Kayser.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nWe have only one letter of his, and it certainly is not prolix, for it consists of but one word, \nἐμάνης\n, addressed to Avidius Cassius when he revolted.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nVit.

There is a difficulty about the birth of this son, as Capit. \nVit. Marci\n, vi. 6, says that Marcus received the \nTrib. Pot.\n on the birth of a daughter, and yet we know he received it in 147. The daughter was born in 146.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nFor these see \nMarcus Antoninus\n in the Loeb series, pp. 366 ff.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nSee Aul.

Graec.\n cxv. p. 1211) state that the bishop reached Rome while Marcus was away fighting the barbarians. He was taken to the \nPraefectus\n Cornelianus and to Faustina, and cured Lucilla, who was then sixteen (which would be in 164 \nA.D.\n), by casting out a devil from her. As a reward he asked for a bath to be made for the hot-springs at Hieropolis, and that 3,000 bushels of corn should be given yearly to that his native city. The epitaph of the bishop has been recovered, and states that he visited Rome and saw \nβασιλῆα[ν] καὶ βασίλισσαν\n. He is said to have cured Publio's mother of blindness.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nMarcus in his \nThoughts\n professes disbelief in exorcism (i. 6). This is only one proof out of many that this letter is a Christian forgery. Christian tradition was strongly in favour of Marcus. Baronius early in the seventeenth century had in his possession a letter purporting to be from Abercius to M. Aurelius, which he intended to publish, but lost.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nFound at the end of Justin's second \nApology\n.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nThis title does not seem to have been assumed till 175. The \"miraculous victory\" took place, as generally held, in 174.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nThough this letter is certainly spurious, yet there must have been a report to the senate by Marcus on the remarkable victory gained over the Quadi, of which both Christian and heathen writers make mention. The latter attributed the victory to the prayers or merits of the emperor, the Christians to the intercessions of the soldiers of their religion in the \nLegio fulminata\n, called from their success \nfulminatrix\n. It is curious, however, that this legion (twelfth) is not mentioned here. The commander was probably Pertinax (see \nChronicon Paschale\n), not Pompeianus, the son-in-law of Marcus. The word \nδράκοντες\n (serpents, \ni.e.\n standards of cohorts) is also used by Lucian, \nQuom. Hist.\n 29. It here stands for the name of the barbarian regiments or divisions (Drungi).\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nAn impossible, because illegal, enactment for Marcus.\n\n\n\n\n↑\n \nHe married Annia Faustina, a cousin of Marcus, and was Consul n. in 176.

He became emperor at the age of 40, after the death of his adoptive father, Antoninus Pius. As emperor, Aurelius is remembered for his military campaigns against Germanic tribes and his efforts to reform the Roman legal system. He also wrote a series of philosophical works known as the Meditations, which have become classic texts on stoicism. Despite his achievements, Aurelius faced many challenges during his reign, including a plague that devastated the Roman Empire and conflicts with neighboring kingdoms.
